**Bühler**—
6. (For all these), excepting Śūdras and those who have committed bad actions, (are ordained) the initiation, the study of the Veda, and the kindling of [#3]  the sacred fire; and (their) works are productive of rewards (in this world and the next).

[#3]:  Manu II, 35.

**satyaśarmā**—
Between 1200-1400 CE, a different version of Āpastambadharmasūtra 1.1.6 'aśūdrāṇāmaduṣṭakarmaṇāmupāyanaṁ..' emerged with the omission of 'a' of 'aśūdrāṇām'. 

Screenshots from Smṛtikaumudī and Harihara's comm. on Pāraskaragṛhyasūtra. Both take 'śūdrāṇām' to denote Rathakāra.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
**upanayanaṁ** vidyārthasya śrutitaḥ saṁskāraḥ 9

**Bühler**—
9. The initiation is the consecration in accordance with the texts of the Veda, of a male who is desirous of (and can make use of) sacred knowledge. [#5] 

[#5]:  The use of the masculine in the text excludes women. For though women may have occasion to use such texts as 'O fire, of the dwelling' &c. at the Agnihotra, still it is specially ordained that they shall be taught this and similar verses only just before the rite is to be performed.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
"sarvēbhyō vēdēbhyaḥ **sāvitry** anūcyata" iti hi brāhmaṇam 10

**Bühler**—
10. A Brāhmaṇa declares that the Gāyatrī is learnt for the sake of all the (three) Vedas. [#6] 

[#6]:  The object of the Sūtra is to remove a doubt whether the ceremony of initiation ought to be repeated for each Veda, in case a man desires to study more than one Veda. This repetition is declared to be unnecessary, except, as the commentator adds, in the case of the Atharva-veda, for which, according to a passage of a Brāhmaṇa, a fresh initiation is necessary. The latter rule is given in the Vaitāna-sūtra I, 1, 5.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tamasō vā ēṣa +++(āgatya)+++ tamaḥ praviśati - yam avidvān upanayatē, yaś cāvidvān - iti hi brāhmaṇam 11

**Bühler**—
11. (Coming) out of darkness, he indeed enters darkness, whom a man unlearned in the Vedas, initiates, and (so does he) who, without being learned in the Vedas, (performs the rite of initiation.) That has been declared in a Brāhmaṇa.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tasminn abhijana-vidyāsamudētaṁ samāhitaṁ saṁskartāram īpsēt 12

**Bühler**—
12. As performer of this rite of initiation he shall seek to obtain a man in whose family sacred learning is hereditary, who himself possesses it, and who is devout (in following the law).

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tasmiṁś caiva vidyā-karma +āntam avipratipannē dharmēbhyaḥ 13

**Bühler**—
13. And under him the sacred science must be [#7]  studied until the end, provided (the teacher) does not fall off from the ordinances of the law.

[#7]:  Haradatta: 'But this (latter rule regarding the taking of p. 3 another teacher) does not hold good for those who have begun to study, solemnly, binding themselves, to their teacher. How so? As he (the pupil) shall consider a person who initiates and instructs him his Ācarya, and a pupil who has been once initiated cannot be initiated again, how can another man instruct him? For this reason it must be understood that the study begun with one teacher may not be completed with another, if the first die.' Compare also Haradatta on I, 2, 7, 26, and the rule given I, 1, 4, 26. In our times also pupils, who have bound themselves to a teacher by paying their respects to him and presenting a cocoa-nut, in order to learn from him a particular branch of science, must not study the same branch of science under any other teacher.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

[#10]:  Manu II, 146-148.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tac +chrēṣṭhaṁ janma 17

**Bühler**—
17. This (second) birth is the best. [#11]

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
śarīram ēva mātā-pitarau janayataḥ 18

**Bühler**—
27. There is no dereliction (of duty, if the initiation takes place), in the case of a Brāhmaṇa before the completion of the sixteenth year, in the case of a Kṣatriya before the completion of the twenty-second year, in the case of a Vaiśya before the completion of the twenty-fourth year. (Let him be initiated at such an age) that he may be able to perform the duties, which we shall declare below. [#16] 

[#16]:  The meaning of the Sūtra is, that the initiation shall be performed as soon as the child is able to begin the study of the Veda. If it is so far developed at eight years, the ceremony must then be performed; and if it be then neglected, or, if it be neglected at any time when the capacity for learning exists, expiation prescribed in the following Sūtras must be performed. The age of sixteen in the case of Brāhmaṇas is the latest term up to which the ceremony may be deferred, in case of incapacity for study only. After the lapse of the sixteenth year, the expiation becomes also necessary. Manu II, 38; Yājñ. I, 37.

atha yasya pitā pitāmaha iti anupētau syātāṁ - tē brahma-ha-saṁstutāḥ 32

**Bühler**—
32. He, whose father and grandfather have not been initiated, (and his two ancestors) are called 'slayers of the Brahman.' [#19] 

[#19]:  Brahman, apparently, here means 'Veda,' and those who neglect its study may be called metaphorically 'slayers of the Veda.'

[#5]:  The commentator declares that in Manu III, 1, the expression until he has learnt it,' must be understood in this sense, that the pupil may leave his teacher, if he has learnt the Veda, after twelve years' study, never before. But compare also Āśv. Gṛ. Sū. I, 22, 3.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
na brahmacāriṇō vidyārthasya parōpavāsō'sti 17

**Bühler**—
17. A student who studies the sacred science shall not dwell with anybody else (than his teacher). [#6] 

[#6]:  The commentator states that this rule refers only to a temporary, not to a professed student (naiṣṭhika). He also gives an entirely different explanation to the Sūtra, which, according to some, means, 'A student who learns the sacred science shall not fast in order to obtain heaven.' This rendering also is admissible, as the word para may mean either a 'stranger' or 'heaven' and upavāsa, 'dwelling' or 'fasting.'

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

[#10]:  Regarding the meaning of kṣāra, 'pungent condiments,' see Haradatta on II, 6, 15, 15. Other commentators explain the term differently.--Manu II, 177; Yājñ. I, 33; and Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 123. Āśv. Gṛ. Sū. I, 22, 2.

**Bühler**—
30. Let him not sport in the water whilst bathing; let him swim (motionless) like a stick. [#15] 

[#15]:  Another version of the first portion of this Sūtra, proposed by Haradatta, is, 'Let him not, whilst bathing, clean himself (with bathing powder or the like).' Another commentator takes Sūtra 28 as a prohibition of the daily bath or washing generally ordained for Brāhmaṇas, and refers Sūtra 29. to the naimittika snāna or 'bathing on certain occasions,' and takes Sūtra 30 as a restriction of the latter.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

38. The staff worn by a Brāhmaṇa should be made of Palāśa wood, that of a Kṣatriya of a branch of the Banian tree, which grows downwards, that of a Vaiśya of Bādara or Udumbara wood. Some declare, without any reference to caste, that the staff of a student should be made of the wood of a tree (that is fit to be used at the sacrifice). [#18] 

[#18]:  Manu II, 45; Yājñ. I, 29; Āśv. Gṛ. Sū. I, 19, 13; 20, 1; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 23.

Other teachers allow, besides, an upper dress of cloth, coloured differently for the different castes, with or without the addition of a deer-skin.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
a-nr̥tta-darśī 11

**Bühler**—

[#9]:  Regarding the explanation of the term Abhiśasta, see below, I, 7, 21, 17. Haradatta: 'Apapātras are called those born from a high-caste mother and a low-caste father, such as washermen. For their cooking vessels &c. are unfit for the use of the four castes. . . . Since Āpastamba says, In the evening and in the morning, food obtained in the evening must not be used for the morning meal, nor food obtained in the morning for the evening meal."' Manu II, 182, 183, 185; Āśv. Gṛ. Sū. I, 22, 4. See also Gopatha-brāhmaṇa I, 2, 6.

nānumānēna bhēkṣam ucchiṣṭaṁ - dr̥ṣṭaśrutābhyāṁ tu 27

**Bühler**—
31. (The pupil) having taken those (alms) shall place them before his teacher and offer them to him. [#12] 

[#12]:  The words with which be announces the alms are, Idam ittham āhṛtam, 'this much have I received.' Manu II, 51; Yājñ. I, 2, 7; Āśv. Gṛ. Sū. I, 22, 10.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tēna pradiṣṭaṁ bhuñjīta 32

**Bühler**—
32. He may eat (the food) after having been ordered to do so by his teacher. [#13]

**Bühler**—
34. If the (family of the teacher) is (also) absent, the pupil (may offer the food) to other learned Brāhmaṇas (Śrotriyas) also (and receive from them the permission to eat). [#14]

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
nātmaprayōjanaścarēt 35

**Bühler**—
35. He shall not beg for his own sake (alone). [#15] 

[#15]:  'The meaning of this Sūtra is, that the rule given, Sūtra 42 (below), for a pupil who is on a journey, shall hold good also for a pupil who is at home, if (in the absence of his teacher) no Śrotriyas are to be found (from whom he can receive the permission to eat).'--Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
bhuktvā svayam amatraṁ prakṣālayīta 36

**Bühler**—
36. After he has eaten, he himself shall clean his dish. [#16] 

[#16]:  'He commits no sin, if he has the alms-pot cleaned by somebody else. Some say that the Sūtra refers to both vessels (the alms-pot and his own dish).'

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
na cōcchiṣṭaṁ kuryāt 37

**Bühler**—
37. And he shall leave no residue (in his dish).

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
āryāya vā paryavadadhyāt 40

**Bühler**—
40. Or he may place (all that remains in a pot), and put it down near an (uninitiated) Ārya; [#17] 

[#17]:  An Ārya is a person belonging to one of the first three castes (see below). The Ārya must be a boy who is not initiated, because children are kāmabhakṣāḥ, i.e. allowed to eat what they like, even leavings.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
antardhinē vā śūdrā ya 41

**Bühler**—
41. Or (he may put it down) near a Śūdra slave (belonging to his teacher).

**Bühler**—
42. If (the pupil) is on a journey, he shall throw [#18]  a part of the alms into the fire and eat (the remainder).

[#18]:  This rule holds good if no Śrotriyas are near. If Śrotriyas are to be found, Sūtra 34 applies. Agni, the god of fire, is considered to be of the Brahminical caste, and hence he takes the place of the teacher or of the Śrotriyas. See also Manu II, 247, p. 14 248, and the passages collected from the Brāhmaṇas, by Prof. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 39.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
āhavanīyārthē ca 44

**Bühler**—
44. And (the teacher holds also the place which) the Āhavanīya fire occupies (at a sacrifice, because a portion of the alms is offered in the fire of his stomach). [#19] 

[#19]:  Manu II, 231.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
taṁ bhōjayitvā yaducchiṣṭam 45

**Bühler**—

**Bühler**—
7. By this (last Sūtra it is) explained (that) the other restrictions (imposed upon a student, such as abstinence from perfumes, ointments, &c., are likewise not to be broken). [#2] 

[#2]:  See above, I, 1, 2, 24 seq.:--According to Haradatta, teachers were in the habit of giving ointments and the like forbidden substances to their pupils, and Āpastamba gives this rule in order to show his dissent from the practice.

8. For (explicit) revealed texts have greater force than custom from which (the existence of a permissive passage of the revelation) may be inferred. [#3] 

[#3]:  'Ānumānika' means "proper to be inferred from." For the existence of a text of the revelation or tradition (Smṛti) is inferred from custom. A visible text of the revelation is (however) of greater weight than a custom from which the existence of a text may be inferred. It is impossible to infer (the existence of a text) which is opposed to such (a visible text), on account of the maxim "an inference (can be made only, if it is) not opposed (by ocular proof)." (Āpastamba), by speaking thus, ("For revealed texts," &c.,) shows that the rule forbidding a student to eat pungent condiments, salt &c. is based on the existing text of a Brāhmaṇa.' --Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
dr̥śyatē cāpi pravr̥ttikāraṇam 9

**Bühler**—
9. Besides (in this particular case) a (worldly) motive for the practice is apparent. [#4] 

[#4]:  'Though the text forbidding the use of pungent condiments salt, and the like refers to such substances if they are not leavings, still it is improper to assert, on the ground of the custom from which a permissive text may be inferred, that it (the existing text), which is general, must be restricted (to those cases only) where the forbidden substances are not leavings given by the teacher. (If an opponent should answer that) certainly there are also texts which contradict each other, such as "he takes" and "he does not take," and that therefore there is no reason why a text restricted (to the case in which forbidden substances are leavings of the teacher) should not be inferred. In order to answer (that plea), he (Āpastamba) says (Sūtra 9), "True, that would be right if no motive whatever could be discovered for that custom (to eat forbidden food which is given by the teacher). But a reason for this course of action exists."'--Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
prītirhy upalabhyatē 10

**Bühler**—
10. For pleasure is obtained (by eating or using the forbidden substances). [#5] 

[#5]:  'What is that (reason)? [Sūtra 10] For to eat pungent condiments, salt, &c. gives pleasure to the eater, and therefore according to the maxim, I, 4, 12, 11, "That in case a custom has pleasure for its motive, there is no text of the holy law to authorise it," no text restricting (the prohibition of forbidden substances to the case in which a Brahmacārin does not receive them as leavings from his teacher) can be inferred (from the practice of eating such leavings).'--Haradatta.

**Bühler**—
14. Daily he shall fetch fuel from the forest, and place it on the floor (in his teacher's house). [#8] 

[#8]:  The reason for placing the fuel on the ground is, according to Haradatta, the fear lest, if placed on some shelf or the like, it should tumble down and injure the teacher's children. Others however, are of opinion that the wood which the pupil fetches daily, is not to be used by the teacher for cooking, but for the performance of the pupil's daily fire-offering. The reason for this interpretation is, that in the Gṛhya-sūtra, II, 24, the daily offering of fuel is enjoined with the same words. See Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 123; Manu II, 186.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

23. Then (after having risen) he shall assist his teacher daily by acts tending to the acquisition of spiritual merit and of wealth. [#12] 

[#12]:  Acts tending to the acquisition of merit are here--collecting sacred fuel, Kuśa grass, and flowers for sacrifices. Acts tending to the acquisition of wealth are--gathering fuel for cooking, &c. Manu II, 182; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 123 and 124.

**Bühler**—

[#15]:  The Sūtra refers to a naiṣṭhika brahmacārin or professed student, who never leaves his teacher's family, and never enters any other order; and it declares his merit to be equal to that of one who becomes a householder. Manu II, 243, 244; Yājñ. I, 49, 50.

[#2]:  The meaning of the phrase, 'Study drives out the Veda, which has already been learnt from him who studies transgressing the rules prescribed for the student,' is, 'The Veda recited at the Brahmayajña (daily study), and other religious rites, produces no effect, i.e. gains no merit for the reciter.' Manu II, 97. Haradatta p. 19 gives also the following three explanations of this Sūtra, adopted by other commentators:--

(The answer is), By virtue of a residue of the reward (due) for the proper observance of those rules (of studentship) in a former Yuga. Therefore Āpastamba says, Sūtra 6 "But some," &c. New existence means "new birth (life)."'--Haradatta.

śūdrā yāṁ tu prēkṣaṇapratiprēkṣaṇayōrēvānadhyāyaḥ 11

**Bühler**—
11. But if (a student and) a Śūdra woman merely look at each other, the recitation of the Veda must be interrupted,

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tathānyasyāṁ striyāṁ varṇavyatikrāntāyāṁ maithunē 12

**Bühler**—
12. Likewise, if (a student and) a woman, who has had connexion with a man of a lower caste, (look at each other).

**Bühler**—
13. If he, who is about to study the Veda, wishes to talk to a woman during her courses, he shall first speak to a Brāhmaṇa and then to her, then again speak to a Brāhmaṇa, and afterwards study. Thereby the children (of that woman) will be blessed. [#8] 

[#8]:  The last part of the Sūtra may also be interpreted: 'Thus she will be blessed with children.'--Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
antaḥśavam 14

**Bühler**—
14. (He shall not study in a village) in which a corpse lies; [#9]

tadaharāgatēṣu ca grāmaṁ bāhyēṣu 18

**Bühler**—
18. And if outcasts have entered the village, he shall not study on that day, [#10] 

[#10]:  Haradatta explains Bāhya, 'outcasts,' by 'robbers, such as Ugras and Niṣādas.' But, I think, it means simply such outcasts as live in the forest or outside the village in the Vādī, like the Dhers, Mahārs, Māngs of the present day. Most of these tribes however, are or were given to thieving. See Kullūka on Manu X, 2 9, and the Petersburg Dict. s. v.

20. If it thunders in the evening, (he shall not study) during the night. [#12] 

[#12]:  Manu IV, 106; Yājñ. I, 145. This rule refers to the rainy season. (For thunder) at other (seasons) he orders below a longer (cessation).'--Haradatta.

**Bühler**—
2. At the time of the Vedotsarga, on the death of Gurus, at the Ashlakā-Śrāddha, and at the time of the Upākarma, (he shall not study) for three days; [#2] 

[#2]:  The construction is very irregular, the first noun standing in the nominative and the rest in the locative. A similar irregularity occurs below, I, 3, 11, 3 1. The Vedotsarga is the ceremony. which is performed at the end of the Brahmanic term, in January. 'In the case of the death of a Guru, the vacation begins with the day on which the death occurs. On the other occasions mentioned he shall not study on the day preceding (the ceremony), on the day (of the ceremony), nor on the day following it.'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 119; Yājñ. I, 144. 'The Gurus' intended here, are fathers-in-law, uncles, &c.

[#3]:  'This rule applies to a student only. It is known from another work that those who have been infected by impurity (on the death of a relation), must not study whilst the impurity lasts. 'Haradatta. Yājñ. I, 144.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
6. Persons who are younger (than the relation deceased), must shave (their hair and beard), [#4] 

[#4]:  The word anubhāvinah, interpreted by Haradatta as 'persons who are younger than the deceased,' is explained in different ways by others; firstly, as 'the mourners,' and secondly, as 'Samānodakas or gentiles beyond the sixth degree.' In the latter case the Sūtra ought to be-translated thus: 'On the death of gentiles beyond the sixth degree, (the head) ought to be shaved.'

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
7. Some declare, that students who have returned home on completion of their studentship, shall never shave, except if engaged in the initiation to a Śrauta-sacrifice. [#5] 

[#5]:  Regarding the Dikṣā initiation,' see Aitareya-brāhmaṇa I, 1, and Max Müller's History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 309 seq.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
athāpi brāhmaṇaṁ - "riktō vā ēṣō'napihitō yan muṇḍaḥ। tasyaitad apidhānaṁ yac chikhē"ti 8

**Bühler**—
8. Now a Brāhmaṇa also declares, 'Verily, an empty, uncovered (pot) is he, whose hair is shaved off entirely; the top-lock is his covering.' [#6] 

[#6]:  Hence it follows that the top-lock should not be shaved off, except in the case mentioned in the following Sūtra.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
satrēṣu tu vacanād vapanaṁ śikhāyāḥ 9

**Bühler**—
9. But at sacrificial sessions the top-lock must be shaved off, because it is so enjoined in the Veda. [#7] 

[#7]:  Sattras, 'sacrificial sessions,' are sacrifices which last longer than twelve days.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
ācāryē trīn ahōrātrān ity ēkē 10

**Bühler**—
10. Some declare, that, upon the death of the teacher, (the reading should be interrupted) for three days and three nights. [#8] 

[#8]:  'But in his opinion it should be twelve days, as declared above, Sūtra 4.'--Haradatta. It appears, therefore, that this Sūtra is to be connected with Sūtra 4.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
śrōtriya-saṁsthāyām aparisaṁvatsarāyām ēkām +++(rātrim)+++ 11

**Bühler**—
11. If (he hears of) the death of a learned Brāhmaṇa (Śrotriya) before a full year (since the death) has elapsed, (he shall interrupt his reading) for one night (and day). [#9] 

[#9]:  'Because the word "death "is used here, death only is the reason (for stopping, the reading), in the case of Gurus and the rest (i.e. the word "died" must be understood in Sūtra 2 and the following ones).' --Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
sabrahmacāriṇīty ēkē 12 …

**Bühler**—
12. Some declare, (that the deceased Śrotriya must have been) a fellow-student.

13-14. If a learned Brāhmaṇa (Śrotriya) has arrived and he is desirous of studying or is actually studying, (or if he is desirous of teaching or is teaching,) he may study or teach after having received permission (to do so from the Śrotriya).

**Bühler**—
18. Or if, whilst they study, another person comes in, he shall continue his recitation, after those words, ('Ho, study!') have been pronounced (by the newcomer). [#12] 

[#12]:  Haradatta states rightly, that the plural ('they study') is useless. According to him, the use of the verb in the singular may be excused thereby, that the advice is addressed to each of the persons engaged in study. Manu IV, 122.

**Bühler**—
19. The barking of (many) dogs, the braying of (many) asses, the cry of a wolf or of a solitary jackal or of an owl, all sounds of musical instruments, of weeping, and of the Sāman melodies (are reasons for discontinuing the study of the Veda). [#13] 

[#13]:  The ekasṛka, 'solitary jackal,' is now called Bālu or Pheough, and is considered to be the constant companion of a tiger or panther. Its unharmonious cry is, in the present day also, considered to be an evil omen. Yājñ. I, 148; Manu IV, 108, 115 and 123.

**Bühler**—
25. Food turned sour (by fermentation), which he has in his stomach, (is a reason for the discontinuance of the recitation, until the sour rising ceases). [#17] 

[#17]:  Manu IV, 121.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
30. But he shall (always) eat in addition (to the meal given in honour of a dead person), food which has not been given at a sacrifice to the Manes. [#22] 

[#22]:  'Because in this Sūtra the expression "food not given at a Śrāddha" occurs, some think that the preceding Sūtra refers to "food eaten at a Śrāddha."'--Haradatta. This explanation is not at all improbable.

### 11 anadhyāyāḥ

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
{anadhyayanam} kāṇḍōpākaraṇē cāmātr̥kasya 1

**Bühler**—
1. (The recitation of the Veda shall be interrupted for a day and evening if he has eaten), on beginning a fresh Kāṇḍa (of his Veda), food given by a motherless person, [#1] 

[#1]:  11. The Black Yajur-veda, to which Āpastamba belongs, is divided throughout into books called Kāṇḍas.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
3. Some declare, that (the recitation shall be interrupted for the same space of time), if he has eaten at a sacrifice offered in honour of gods who were formerly men. [#2] 

[#2]:  Haradatta names as such gods, Nandīsvara and Kubera. Other commentators, however, explain Manuṣyaprakriti by Manuṣyamukha, 'possessing human faces.' A similar rule occurs Gautama XVI, 34, Where a Manuṣyayagña is mentioned as a cause for discontinuing the recitation of the Veda. In his Commentary on Gautama, also, Haradatta is in doubt. He first refers the term to the sacraments like the Sīmantonnayana, and then adds, that some explain it to mean 'a sacrifice to gods who formerly were men.'

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
paryuṣitaistaṇḍulairāmamāṁsēna ca nānadhyāyāḥ 4

**Bühler**—
4. Nor is the recitation interrupted, if he has eaten rice received the day before, or raw meat (though these things may have been offered in honour of the dead), [#3]

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

6. When he performs the ceremony for beginning of a Kāṇḍa, or when he studies the index of the Anuvākas [#4]  of a (Kāṇḍa), he shall not study that (Kāṇḍa) on that day (nor in that night).

[#4]:  Haradatta's commentary on this Sūtra is very meagre, and he leaves the word anuvākyam unexplained. I am not certain that my explanation is correct. But it is countenanced by the statements of the Gṛhya-sutras regarding the order of studying. Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 132.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
upākaraṇasamāpanayōśca pārāyaṇasya tāṁ vidyām 7

**Bühler**—
7. And if he performs the ceremonies prescribed on beginning or ending the recitation of one entire Veda, he shall not study that Veda (during that day). [#5] 

[#5]:  Yājñ. I, 145. This Sūtra is a Jñāpaka or 'such a one which indicates the existence of a rule not expressly mentioned! Above (I, 3, 9, 1) the yearly -performance of the Upākarma and Utsarga ceremonies for the beginning and end of the Brahmanic term has been prescribed. In this Sūtra the performance of the Upakarma and Utsarga at the beginning and completion of the Pārāyana or the vow to go through a whole Veda is incidentally mentioned. Thence it may be inferred that these ceremonies must. be likewise performed on the latter occasions, though no absolute rule to this effect has been given. Such Jñāpakas are of frequent occurrence in all Sūtras, and constitute one of the chief difficulties of their interpretation.

**Bühler**—
20. During the spring festival and the festival (of Indra), in the month of Āṣāḍha (June-July), the study of an Anuvāka is forbidden. [#10] 

[#10]:  According to Haradatta, Āpastamba uses the word Anuvāka in order to indicate that smaller portions of the Veda may be studied. Others think, that by Anuvāka, the Saṃhitā and the Brāhmaṇa are meant, and that the study of the Aṅgas is permitted. The Vasantotsava, or spring festival, which, according to the Dramas, was, in olden times, kept all over India, falls, according to Haradatta, on the thirteenth of the first half of Caitra, about the beginning of April.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

[#12]:  See Taittirīya Āraṇyaka II, 11, 1 and 11; Āśv. Gṛ. Sū. III, 2, 1-2. In our days this rule is usually not observed. Brāhmaṇas mostly recite at the daily Brahmayajña, 'Veda-offering,' one particular formula, which symbolically comprises the whole Veda. A few learned Brāhmaṇa friends, however, have assured me, that they still recite the whole of their Śākhā every year according to this rule of Āpastamba.

[#17]:  Manu IV, 104, and see above.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
muhūrtaṁ viratē vātē 32

**Bühler**—
32. After the wind has ceased, (the interruption of the recitation continues) for one muhūrta. [#18] 

[#18]:  One muhūrta = 48 minutes.

**Bühler**—
33. If (the howl of) a wolf or of a solitary jackal (has been heard, he shall stop the reading) until he has slept.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

yathōktamanyadataḥ pariṣatsu 38

**Bühler**—
38. Further particulars (regarding the interruption [#21]  of the Veda-study may be learnt) from the (teaching and works of other) Vedic schools.

[#21]:  Haradatta thinks that by 'Pariṣad,' Manu's and other Dharma-śāstras are meant. This explanation is, however, not exact. Pariṣad, 'assemblage,' means, in the language of the Śāstras, either a Pañc, an assemblage of learned Brahmans called together to decide some knotty point of law, or a Brahminical school, which studies a particular redaction of the Veda (see the Petersburg Dict. s. v.) The latter meaning is that applicable to this Sūtra. By 'Pariṣadaḥ' are here intended the Vedic schools, and their writings and teaching. Gautama also says, XVI, 40. Prātividyaṃ yān smarantismaranti, '(he shall observe the stoppages of the Veda-study) which they teach in (the writings belonging to) each of the Vedas.'

### 12 pañca-mahā-yajñāḥ

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tapaḥ svādhyāya iti brāhmaṇam 1

**Bühler**—
1. A Brāhmaṇa declares, 'The daily recitation (of the Veda) is austerity.' [#1] 

[#1]:  12. 'It procures as much reward as penance.'--Haradatta. Manu II, 166; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 113. The phrase occurs frequently in the Brāhmaṇas, e.g. Taitt. Ār. II, 14, 3.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tatra śrūyatē । sa yadi tiṣṭhann āsīnaḥ śayānō vā svādhyāyamadhītē tapa ēva tattapyatē tapō hi svādhyāya iti 2

**Bühler**—
2. In the same (sacred text) it is also declared, Whether he recites the daily portion of the Veda standing, or sitting, or lying down, he performs austerity thereby; for the daily recitation is austerity.' [#2] 

[#2]:  Regarding the proper position at the 'Veda-offering,' or daily recitation, see above, I, 3, 11, 2 3, and Taitt. Ār. II, 11, 3. Passages similar to the first part of the sentence quoted in this Sūtra occur Taitt. Ār II, 12, 3, and 15, 3. It ought to be observed that the Taitt. Ār. in both places has the word 'vrajan,' which is also read in the P. and P. U. MSS. The second part is taken apparently from the same work, II, 14, 2.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
athāpi vājasanēyibrāhmaṇam । brahmayajñō ha vā ēṣa yatsvādhyāyastasyaitē vaṣaṭkārā yatstanayati yadvidyōtatē yadavasphūrjati yadvātō vāyati । tasmātstanayati vidyōtamānē'vasphūrjati vātē vā vāyatyadhīyītaiva vaṣaṭkārāṇāmacchambaṭkārāyēti 3

**Bühler**—
3. Now the Vājasaneyi-brāhmaṇa declares also, 'The daily recitation is a sacrifice at which the Veda is offered. When it thunders, when lightning flashes or thunderbolts fall, and when the wind blows violently, these sounds take the place of the exclamations Vaṣaṭ (Vauṣaṭ and Svāhā). Therefore he shall recite the Veda whilst it thunders, whilst lightning flashes and thunderbolts fall, and whilst the wind blows violently, lest the Vaṣaṭ (should be heard) in vain. [#3] 

[#3]:  See Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa XI, 5, 6, 8, where a passage very similar to that quoted by Āpastamba occurs. Vaṣaṭ and the other exclamations, which are pronounced by the Hotṛ-priest, serve as signals for the Adhvaryu to throw the oblations into the fire.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tasya śākhāntarē vākyasamāptiḥ 4

**Bühler**—
4. The conclusion of the passage from that (Vājasaneyi-brāhmaṇa is found) in another Śākhā (of the Veda).

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
atha yadi vātō vā vāyāt stanayēd vā vidyōtēta vāvasphūrjēd vaikāṁ varcamēkaṁ vā yajurēkaṁ vā sāmābhivyāharēdbhūrbhuvaḥ suvaḥ satyaṁ tapaḥ śraddhāyāṁ juhōmīti vaitat । tēnō haivāsyaitadahaḥ svādhyāya upāttō bhavati 5

**Bühler**—
5. 'Now, if the wind blows, or if it thunders, or if lightning flashes, or thunderbolts fall, then he shall recite one Ṛk-verse (in case he studies the Rig-Veda), or one Yajus (in case he studies the Yajur-veda), or one Sāman (in case he studies the Sāma-veda), or (without having a regard to his particular Veda, the following Yajus), "Bhūḥ Bhuvaḥ, Suvaḥ, in faith I offer true devotion." Then, indeed, his daily recitation is accomplished thereby for that day.' [#4] 

[#4]:  'Some suppose that the words Bhūḥ Bhuvaḥ and Suvaḥ &c. (are to be used only) if one studies the Brāhmaṇa portion of the Veda, not every where.'-- Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
ēvaṁ satyāryasamayēnāvipratiṣiddham 6

**Bühler**—
6. If that is done, (if the passage of the Vājasaneyi-brāhmaṇa is combined with that quoted in Sūtra 5, the former stands) not in contradiction with the decision of the Āryas. [#5] 

[#5]:  Haradatta explains Āryas by viśiṣṭāḥ, 'excellent ones,' i.e. persons who know the law, and he gives Manu as an instance.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
adhyāyānadhyāyaṁ hyupadiśanti । tadanarthakaṁ syādvājasanēyibrāhmaṇaṁ cēdavēkṣēta 7

**Bühler**—
7. For they (who know the law) teach both the continuance and the interruption (of the daily recitation of the Veda). That would be meaningless, if one paid attention to the (passage of the) Vājasaneyi-brāhmaṇa (alone).

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
āryasamayō hyagr̥hyamānakāraṇaḥ 8

**Bühler**—
8. For no (worldly) motive for the decision of those Āryas is perceptible; (and hence it must have a religious motive and be founded on a passage of the Veda). [#6] 

[#6]:  See above, I, 1, 4, 9 and 10. and notes.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
vidyāṁ pratyanadhyāyaḥ śrūyatē na karmayōgē mantrāṇām 9

**Bühler**—
9. (The proper interpretation therefore is, that) the prohibition to study (given above and by the

Āryas generally) refers only to the repetition of the sacred texts in order to learn them, not to their application at sacrifices.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
brāhmaṇōktā vidhayastēṣāmutsannāḥ pāṭhāḥ prayōgādanumīyantē 10

**Bühler**—
10. (But if you ask, why the decision of the Āryas presupposes the existence of a Vedic passage, then I answer): All precepts were (originally) taught in the Brāhmaṇas, (but) these texts have been lost. Their (former existence) may, however, be inferred from usage. [#7] 

[#7]:  How then is their existence known? 'They are inferred from usage.' '"Usage" means the teaching of the law-books and the practice. From that it is inferred that Manu and other (authors of law-books) knew such texts of the Brāhmaṇas. For how could otherwise (Ṛṣis like Manu) teach in their works or practise (such customs) for which no authority is now found? And certainly they were intimately connected with the revealed texts (i.e. saw them).'-- Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
yatra tu prītyupalabdhitaḥ pravr̥ttirna tatra śāstramasti 11

**Bühler**—
11. But it is not (permissible to infer the former existence of) a (Vedic) passage in cases where pleasure is obtained (by following a rule of the Smṛti or a custom). [#8] 

[#8]:  Compare above, I, 1, 4, 8-10.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tadanuvartamānō narakāya rādhyati 12

**Bühler**—
12. He who follows such (usages) becomes fit for hell.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
atha brāhmaṇōktā vidhayaḥ 13

**Bühler**—
13. Now follow (some rites and) rules that have been declared in the Brāhmaṇas. [#9] 

[#9]:  The consequence of the introduction of these rules into a Smṛti work is, that their omission must be expiated by a Smārta penance and not by a Śrauta one.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tēṣāṁ mahāyajñā mahāsattrāṇīti saṁstutiḥ 14

**Bühler**—
14. By way of laudation they are called 'great sacrifices ' or 'great sacrificial sessions.' [#10] 

[#10]:  The commentator observes, that, as these rites are called 'great sacrifices,' by way of laudation only, the particular laws binding on performers of real Soma-sacrifices cannot be transferred to the performers of these ceremonies. Regarding the p. 48 term 'great sacrifices,' see also Taitt. Ār. II, 11, 10, 1 seq., and Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa XI, 59 6, 1.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
aharaharbhūtabalirmanuṣyēbhyō yathāśakti dānam 15

**Bühler**—
15. (These rites include): The daily Bali-offering to the (seven classes of) beings; the (daily) gift of (food) to men according to one's power;

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
dēvēbhyaḥ svāhākāra ā kāṣṭhāt, pitr̥bhyaḥ svadhākāra ōdapātrāt, svādhyāya iti 1

**Bühler**—
1. The oblation to the gods accompanied by the exclamation Svāhā, which may consist even of a piece of wood only; the offering to the Manes accompanied by the exclamation Svadhā, which may consist even of a vessel with water only; the daily recitation. [#1] 

[#1]:  13. Taitt. Ār. II, 10, 2 and 3, and Śatapatha-br. loc. cit. 2. Haradatta observes, that some consider the Devayajña, mentioned in the Sūtra, to be different from the Vaiśvadeva, but that he holds it to be the same. Further he mentions, that some prescribe this Vaiśvadeva to be performed even if one has nothing to eat.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
pūjā varṇajyāyasāṁ kāryā 2

**Bühler**—
2. Respect must be shown to those who are superior by caste, [#2] 

[#2]:  'Namely, by allowing them to walk in front on the road and by giving them perfumed garlands and the like at festive occasions.'--Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
vr̥ddhatarāṇāṁ ca 3

**Bühler**—
3. And also to (persons of the same caste who are) venerable (on account of learning, virtue, and the like).

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
hr̥ṣṭō darpati dr̥ptō dharmamatikrāmati dharmātikramē khalu punarnarakaḥ 4

**Bühler**—
4. A man elated (with success) becomes proud, a proud man transgresses the law, but through the transgression of the law hell indeed (becomes his portion).

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
na samāvr̥ttē samādēśō vidyatē 5

**Bühler**—
5. It has not been declared, that orders (may be addressed by the teacher) to a pupil who has returned home. [#3] 

[#3]:  Haradatta gives as an example the order to fetch water, and adds that a voluntary act on a former pupil's part ought not to be forbidden.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
ōṁkāraḥ svargadvāraṁ tasmādbrahmādhyēṣyamāṇa ētadādi pratipadyēta 6

**Bühler**—
6. The syllable 'Om' is the door of heaven. [#4]  Therefore he who is about to study the Veda, shall begin (his lesson) by (pronouncing) it.

[#4]:  Compare also Taitt. Ār. I, 2, 4, and Manu II, 74.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
vikathāṁ cānyāṁ kr̥tvaivaṁ laukikyā vācā vyāvartatē brahma 7

**Bühler**—
7. If he has spoken anything else (than what refers to the lesson, he shall resume his reading by repeating the word 'Om'). Thus the Veda is separated from profane speech.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
yajñēṣu caitadādayaḥ prasavāḥ 8

**Bühler**—
8. And at sacrifices the orders (given to the priests) are headed by this word.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
lōkē ca bhūtikarmasvētadādīnyēva vākyāni syuryathā puṇyāhaṁ svastyr̥ddhimiti 9

**Bühler**—
9. And in common life, at the occasion of ceremonies performed for the sake of welfare, the sentences shall be headed by this word, as, for instance, '(Om) an auspicious day,' '(Om) welfare,' '(Om) prosperity.' [#5] 

[#5]:  The example given in the Sūtra is that of the Puṇyāhavācana, which precedes every Gṛhya ceremony, and at which the sacrificer requests a number of invited Brāhmaṇas to wish him success. The complete sentences are, The sacrificer: Oṃ karmaṇaḥ puṇyāham bhavanto bruvantviti, 'Om, wish that the day may be auspicious for the performance of the ceremony.' The Brāhmaṇas: Om puṇyāhaṃ karmaṇa itī, 'Om, may the day be auspicious for the ceremony.' In the same manner the Brāhmaṇas afterwards wish 'welfare,' svasti, 'prosperity,' vṛddhi, to the sacrificer.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
nāsamayēna kr̥cchraṁ kurvīta triḥśrāvaṇaṁ triḥsahavacanamiti parihāpya 10

**Bühler**—
10. Without a vow of obedience (a pupil) shall not study (nor a teacher teach) a difficult (new book) with the exception of (the texts called) Triḥsrāvaṇa and Tr.ihsahavacana. [#6] 

[#6]:  Manu II, 112.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
avicikitsā yāvad brahma nigantavyam iti hārītaḥ 11 +++(????)+++

**Bühler**—
11. Hārita declares, that the (whole) Veda must be studied under a vow of obedience until there is no doubt (regarding it in the mind of the pupil). [#7] 

[#7]:  The meaning of Hārita is, that the vow of obedience is required for the Triḥsrāvaṇa and Tr.ihsahavacana, which Āpastamba exempted in the preceding Sūtra. It follows from this rule that the Aṅgas or works explanatory of the Veda need not be studied under a vow of obedience.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
na bahirvēdē gatirvidyatē 12

**Bühler**—
12. No obedience is due (to the teacher for teaching) works which do not belong to the Veda.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
13. (A student) shall embrace the feet of a person, who teaches him at the request of his (regular teacher), as long as the instruction lasts. [#8] 

[#8]:  This rule is a Supplement to I, 2, 7, 29.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
nityamarhantamityēkē 14

**Bühler**—
14. Some (declare, that he shall also) always, (if the substitute is) a worthy person. [#9]

15. But obedience (as towards the teacher) is not required (to be shown towards such a person).

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
vr̥ddhānāṁ tu 16

**Bühler**—
16. And (pupils) older (than their teacher need not show him obedience). [#10] 

[#10]:  'According to some, this rule refers only to the time after instruction has been completed; according to others, to the time of studentship.'--Haradatta. But see Manu II, 151 seq.

**Bühler**—

23. In saluting women, a Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya he shall use a pronoun, not his name. [#15] 

[#15]:  He shall say, 'I salute,' not 'I, N. N., salute.' Manu II, 123.

**Bühler**—

**Bühler**—
1. When he shows his respect to Gurus or aged persons or guests, when he offers a burnt-oblation (or other sacrifice), when he murmurs prayers at dinner, when sipping water and during the (daily) recitation of the Veda, his garment (or his sacrificial thread) shall pass over his left shoulder and under his right arm.

**Bühler**—
2. By sipping (pure) water, that has been collected on the ground, he becomes pure. [#2] 

[#2]:  Pure water is that which a cow will drink. Yājñ. I, 192; Manu V, 128.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
yaṁ vā prayata ācāmayēt 3

**Bühler**—
3. Or he, whom a pure person causes to sip water, (becomes also pure). [#3] 

[#3]:  The ceremony of 'sipping water' may be performed in two ways; either the 'person sipping' may take the water out of a river, pond, &c., or he may get the water poured into his hand by another person. But, according to Āpastamba, he must not take a pot or gourd in his left hand and pour the water into his right, as some Smṛtis allow. The reason for this rule is, that Āpastamba considers it essential that both hands should be used in conveying the water to the mouth; see also above, I, 1, 4, 21. This agrees with the custom now followed, which is to bend the right hand into the form of a cow's ear, and to touch the right wrist with the left hand while drinking.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
na varṣadhārāsvācāmēt 4

**Bühler**—
4. He shall not sip rain-drops. [#4] 

[#4]:  'Some think, that this Sūtra is intended to forbid also the drinking of rain-water. Other commentators declare that, according to this Sūtra, it is allowed to use for "sipping" drops of water which fall from a vessel suspended by ropes [because the Sūtra emphatically excludes "rain-drops only].'--Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
taptābhiścākāraṇāt 6

**Bühler**—
6. He shall not sip water heated (at the fire) except for a particular reason (as sickness). [#5] 

[#5]:  Manu II, 61. 'Because the term "heated by fire" is used, there is no objection to water heated by the rays of the sun. In the same manner the use of, "hot" water only is usually forbidden in the Smṛtis.'-- Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
- riktapāṇir vayasa udyamyāpa upaspr̥śēt 7

**Bühler**—
7. He who raises his empty hands (in order to scare) birds, (becomes impure and) shall wash (his hands). [#6] 

[#6]:  'Because the phrase "with empty hands" is used, he commits no fault if he raises his hand, holding a stick or a clod. Some declare, that the term "touching water" (rendered by "washing means "sipping water."'--Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
uttīrya tvācāmēt 11

**Bühler**—
11. Also, when he has crossed a river, he shall purify himself by sipping water. [#7] 

[#7]:  The translation given above is based on the interpretation of Haradatta, who considers that Āpastamba holds 'crossing a river' to cause impurity. The natural and probably the right interpretation, however, is that rejected by Haradatta, 'But he shall sip water after having come out (of the river or tank).'

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
nāprōkṣitamindhanamagnāvādadhyāt 12

**Bühler**—
12. He shall not place fuel on the fire, without having sprinkled it (with water). [#8] 

[#8]:  '"On the fire used for Vedic or Smārta sacrifices or for household purposes.". . . Some declare, that (the fuel need not be sprinkled with water) if used for the kitchen fire.'--Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tathā tr̥ṇakāṣṭhēṣu nikhātēṣu 14

**Bühler**—
14. (The same rule applies, if he is seated) on grass or wood fixed in the ground. [#9] 

[#9]:  Haradatta's commentary is of little use, and I am not quite certain that my translation is correct.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
prōkṣya vāsa upayōjayēt 15

**Bühler**—
15. He shall put on a dress, (even if it is clean,) only after having sprinkled it with water. [#10]

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
prakṣālya vā taṁ dēśam agninā saṁspr̥śya punaḥ prakṣālya pādau cācamya prayatō bhavati 17

**Bühler**—
17. Or he becomes pure, after having washed that part (of his body) and having touched it with fire and again washed it, as well as his feet, and having sipped water. [#11] 

[#11]:  This second proceeding is adopted in case the dog has touched the hands or the lower parts of the body, as may be learnt by the comparison of a verse of Manu.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
agniṁ nāprayata āsīdēt 18

**Bühler**—
18. Unpurified, he shall not approach fire, (so near that he can feel the heat). [#12]

19. Some declare, that (he shall not approach nearer) than the length of an arrow.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
na cainamupadhamēt 20

**Bühler**—
20. Nor shall he blow on fire with his breath. [#13] 

[#13]:  Manu IV, 53. Haradatta mentions other explanations of this Sūtra. Some say, that the Śrauta fire may be kindled by blowing, because that is ordained particularly in the Vājasaneyaka, but that the domestic fire is not to be treated so. Others again consider the rule absolute, and say, that a hollow reed or bellows must be used for kindling the fire, lest drops of saliva should fall upon it.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
khaṭvāyāṁ ca nōpadadhyāt 21

**Bühler**—
21. Nor shall he place fire under his bedstead. [#14] 

[#14]:  Manu IV, 54.

**Bühler**—
22. It is lawful for a Brāhmaṇa to dwell in a village, where there is plenty of fuel and water, (and) where he may perform the rites of purification by himself. [#15] 

[#15]:  The last condition mentioned in the Sūtra indicates, that the place must have a river or tank, not wells only, as the purification by sipping water cannot be performed without help, with water from wells.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
- mūtraṁ kr̥tvā purīṣaṁ vā mūtrapurīṣa-lēpān annalēpān ucchiṣṭalēpān rētasaś ca yē lēpās, tān prakṣālya pādau ca, +ācamya prayatō bhavati 23

**Bühler**—
1. He shall not drink water standing or bent forwards. [#1] 

[#1]:  16. Haradatta takes ācam here to mean 'to drink water,' and thinks that it is forbidden to do this standing or in a bent position. Others refer the prohibition to 'sipping water for the sake of purification,' and translate, 'He shall not sip water standing or in a bent position (except in case of necessity),' i.e. if the bank of the river is so high that he cannot reach the water sitting down, and in this case he shall enter it up to his thighs or up to his navel.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
āsīnastrirācāmēddhr̥dayaṅgamābhiradbhiḥ 2

**Bühler**—
2. Sitting he shall sip water (for purification) thrice, the water penetrating to his heart. [#2] 

[#2]:  Manu II, 60 and 62; V, 139; and Yājñ. I, 20 and 27; Weber. Ind. Stud. X, 165. Haradatta observes, that the further particulars regarding purification by sipping water must be supplied from other Smṛtis. The rule quoted by him is as follows: 'The performer should be sitting in a pure place, not on a seat, except when sipping water after dinner, and should sip thrice from his hand water which is free from bubbles and foam, and which he has attentively regarded, in such a quantity as would cover a Māṣa-bean. p. 58 The water sipped by a Brahman should reach his heart, that sipped by a Kṣatriya the throat, and that sipped by a Vaiśya the palate. A Śūdra sips once as much as to wet his tongue.'

**Bühler**—
11. He does not become impure by the hair (of his moustaches) getting into his mouth, as long as he does not touch them with his hand. [#5] 

[#5]:  Haradatta observes that this Sūtra shows, that every other foreign substance brought with the food into the mouth, makes the food 'leavings' and the eater impure. Manu V, 141.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
- ya āsyādbindavaḥ patanta upalabhyantē tēṣvācamanaṁ vihitam 12

**Bühler**—
12. If (in talking), drops (of saliva) are perceived to fall from his mouth, then he shall sip water. [#6]

**Bühler**—
18. He shall not eat in the house of a (relation within six degrees) where a person has died, before the ten days (of impurity) have elapsed. [#8] 

[#8]:  The term "ten days" is used in order to indicate the time of impurity generally. In some cases, as that of a Kṣatriya, this lasts longer. In other cases, where the impurity lasts thirty-six hours only, (the abstention from dining in such houses is shorter.)'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 217.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
19. (Nor shall he eat in a house) where a lying-in woman has not (yet) come out (of the lying-in chamber), [#9] 

[#9]:  A lying-in woman is impure, and must not be touched during the first ten days after her confinement. During this time, she exclusively occupies the Sūtikāgṛha, or lying-in chamber. Manu IV, 217.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
20. (Nor in a house) where a corpse lies. [#10]

**Bühler**—
24. Or any other unclean substance. [#14] 

[#14]:  Haradatta quotes a passage from Baudhāyana, which enumerates as 'unclean things' here intended, 'hair, worms or beetles, nail-parings, excrements of rats.' The rule must be understood as the preceding, i.e. in case these things have been cooked with the food.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
36. Common cranes and Sāras-cranes (are not to [#24]  be eaten) with the exception of the leather-nosed Lakṣmaṇa.

[#24]:  Manu V, 12; Yājñ. I, 172. Other commentators take the whole Sūtra as one compound, and explain it as an exception to Sūtra 34. In that case the translation runs thus: ('Carnivorous birds are forbidden) except the Kruñca, Krauñca, Vārdhrāṇasa, p. 65 and Lakṣmaṇa.'--Haradatta. This translation is objectionable, because both the Kruñca, now called Kulam or Kūñc, and the Krauñca, the red-crested crane, now called Sāras (Cyrus), feed on grain. Kruñcakrauñca is a Vedic dual and stands for kruñcakrauñcā or kruñcakrauñcau.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
39. Nor the snake-headed fish, nor the alligator, nor those which live on flesh only, nor those which are misshaped (like) mermen. [#26] 

[#26]:  Haradatta closes this chapter on flesh-eating by quoting Manu V, 56, which declares flesh-eating, drinking spirituous liquor, and promiscuous intercourse to be allowable, but the abstinence therefrom of greater merit. He states that the whole chapter must be understood in this sense.

4. (Of such food) they shall not take a great quantity (but only so much as suffices to support life). [#2]

**Bühler**—
8. He shall not be too eager after (such a way of living). He shall leave it when he has obtained a (lawful) livelihood. [#3] 

[#3]:  Haradatta quotes, in support of the last Sūtras, a passage of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, I, 10, 1, and one from the .Ṛj-veda, IV, 18, 13, according to which it would be lawful to eat even impure food, as a dog's entrails, under such circumstances. Other commentators explain this and the preceding three Sūtras differently. According to them the translation would run thus: 'If he himself does not find any livelihood (in times of distress, he may dwell even with low-caste people who give him something to eat, and) he may eat (food given by them) paying for it with (some small gift in) gold or with animals.' This second explanation is perhaps preferable.

[#1]:  19. Manu IV, 207; Yājñ. I, 161, 162. Another commentator explains aṇika, translated above 'he who learns the Veda from his son,' by 'a money-lender,' and combines pratyupaviṣṭaḥ with this word, i.e. 'a money-lender who sits with his debtor hindering him from fulfilling his duties.' This manner of forcing a debtor to pay, which is also called Ācarita (see Manu VIII, 49), is, though illegal, resorted to sometimes even now.

9. (Food offered) willingly by a holy man may be eaten.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
puṇyasyāpy +++(dātum)+++ anīpsatō na bhōktavyam 10

**Bühler**—
10. Food given unwillingly by a holy man ought not to be eaten. [#4] 

[#4]:  Another commentator explains this Sūtra thus: 'He need not eat the food offered by a righteous man, if he himself does not wish to do so.'--Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
yataḥ kutaścābhyudyataṁ bhōktavyam 11

**Bühler**—
11. Food offered unasked by any person whatsoever may be eaten,

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
nānaniyōgapūrvamiti hārītaḥ 12

**Bühler**—
12. 'But not if it be given after an express previous announcement;' thus says Hārita.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
13. Now they quote also in a Purāṇa the following two verses: [#5] 

[#5]:  See Manu IV, 248 and 249, where these identical verses occur.

'The Lord of creatures has declared, that food offered unasked and brought by the giver himself, may be eaten, though (the giver be) a sinner, provided the gift has not been announced beforehand. The Manes of the ancestors of that man who spurns such food, do not eat (his oblations) for fifteen years, nor does the fire carry his offerings (to the gods).'

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
cikitsakasya mr̥gayōḥ śalyakr̥ntasya pāśinaḥ । kulaṭāyāḥ ṣaṇḍhakasya ca tēṣāmannamanādyam 14

**Bühler**—
14. (Another verse from a Purāṇa declares): 'The food given by a physician, a hunter, a surgeon, a fowler, an unfaithful wife, or a eunuch must not be eaten.' [#6] 

[#6]:  Manu IV, 211, 212.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
athāpyudāharanti । annādē bhrūṇahā mārṣṭi anēnā abhiśaṁsati । stēnaḥ pramuktō rājani yācannanr̥tasaṅkara iti 15

**Bühler**—
15. Now (in confirmation of this) they quote (the following verse): 'The murderer of a Brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda heaps his guilt on his guest, an innocent man on his calumniator, a thief set at liberty on the king, and the petitioner on him who makes false promises.' [#7] 

[#7]:  Regarding the liberation of the thief, see Āpastamba I, 9, 25, 4. A similar verse occurs Manu VIII, 317, which has caused the confusion observable in many MSS., as has been stated in the critical notes to the text.

**Bühler**—
7. But that is virtue, the practice of which wise men of the three twice-born castes praise; what they blame, is sin. [#1] 

[#1]:  20. The Sūtra is intended to show how the law should be ascertained in difficult cases. Haradatta quotes here the passage of Yājñ. I, 9, on Pariṣads, and states that the plural āryāḥ shows that three or four must be employed to arrive at a decision. See also Manu XII, 108 seq.

**Bühler**—
11. In times of distress he may trade in lawful merchandise, avoiding the following (kinds), that are forbidden: [#3] 

[#3]:  This Sūtra, which specifies only one part of a Vaiśya's occupations as permissible for Brāhmaṇas in distress, implies, according to Haradatta, that his other occupations also, as well as those of a Kṣatriya, are permissible. Manu IV, 6; X, 82; Yājñ. III, 35.

**Bühler**—
2. And with (other kinds of) grass and wood which have not been worked up (into objects of use). [#1] 

[#1]:  21. 'Since it is known that Muñja and Balbaja are kinds of grass, it may be inferred from their being especially mentioned (in Sūtra 1) that objects made of them (may be also sold).'--Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

8. (These are) stealing (gold), crimes whereby one becomes an Abhiśasta, homicide, neglect of the Vedas, causing abortion, incestuous connection with relations born from the same womb as one's mother or father, and with the offspring of such persons, drinking spirituous liquor, and intercourse with persons the intercourse with whom is forbidden. [#5] 

[#5]:  The crimes by which a person becomes Abhiśasta are enumerated below, I, 9, 24, 6 seq., where an explanation of the term will be given.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
gurvī-sakhiṁ guru-sakhiṁ ca gatvā

### 22 adhyātmam

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
adhyātmikān yōgān anutiṣṭhēn nyāya-saṁhitān anaiścārikān 1

**Bühler**—
1. He shall employ the means which tend to the acquisition of (the knowledge of) the Ātman, which are attended by the consequent (destruction of the passions, and) which prevent the wandering (of the mind from its object, and fix it on the contemplation of the Ātman). [#1] 

[#1]:  22. The knowledge of the Vedānta and the means which prepare men for the knowledge of the Ātman, the 'Self, the universal soul,' are placed in this Paṭala at the head of the penances, because they are most efficacious for the removal of all sin. The means are absence of anger &c., which are enumerated I, 8, 23, 6.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
ātma-lābhān na paraṁ vidyatē 2

**Bühler**—
2. There is no higher (object) than the attainment of (the knowledge of the) Ātman. [#2] 

[#2]:  Haradatta gives in his commentary a lengthy discussion on the Ātman, which corresponds nearly to Śaṅkara's Introduction to and Commentary on the first Sūtra of Bādarāyaṇa.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tatrātmalābhīyāñ ślōkān udāhariṣyāmaḥ 3

**Bühler**—
3. We shall quote the verses (from the Veda) [#3]  which refer to the attainment of (the knowledge of) the Ātman.

[#3]:  According to Haradatta, the following verses are taken from an Upaniṣad.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
pūḥ prāṇinaḥ sarva ēva guhāśayasya । ahanyamānasya vikalmaṣasya ।  
acalaṁ calanikētaṁ yē'nutiṣṭhanti tē'mr̥tāḥ 4

**Bühler**—
4. All living creatures are the dwelling of him who lies enveloped in matter, who is immortal and who is spotless. Those become immortal who worship him who is immovable and lives in a movable dwelling. [#4] 

[#4]:  The spotless one &c. is the Paramātman. The spots are merit and demerit which, residing in the Manas, the internal organ of perception, are only falsely attributed to the Ātman, 'the soul.' To become immortal means 'to obtain final liberation.'

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
yadidamidihēdiha lōkē viṣayamucyatē । vidhūya kavirētadanutiṣṭhēdguhāśayam 5

**Bühler**—
5. Despising all that which in this world is called an object (of the senses) a wise man shall strive after the (knowledge of the) Ātman. [#5] 

[#5]:  It seems to me that Haradatta's explanation of the words 'idam idi ha idi ha' is wrong. They ought to be divided thus, 'idamid, iha id, iha loke.' The general sense remains the same, and there is no necessity to assume very curious and otherwise unknown Vedic forms.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
ātmann ēvāhamalabdhvaitaddhitaṁ sēvasva nāhitam । athānyēṣu pratīcchāmi sādhuṣṭhānamanapēkṣayā । mahāntaṁ tējasaskāyaṁ sarvatra nihitaṁ prabhum 6

**Bühler**—
6. O pupil, I, who had not recognised in my own self the great self-luminous, universal, (absolutely) free Ātman, which must be obtained without the mediation of anything else, desired (to find) it in others (the senses). (But now as I have obtained the pure knowledge, I do so no more.) Therefore follow thou also this good road that leads to welfare (salvation), and not the one that leads into misfortune (new births). [#6] 

[#6]:  The verse is addressed by a teacher to his pupil. My translation strictly follows Haradatta's gloss. But his interpretation is open to many doubts. However, I am unable to suggest anything better.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
sarvabhūtēṣu yō nityō vipaścidamr̥tō dhruvaḥ । anaṅgō 'śabdō'śarīrō'sparśaśca mahāñśuciḥ । sa sarvaṁ paramā kāṣṭhā sa vaiṣuvataṁ sa vai vaibhājanaṁ puram 7

**Bühler**—
7. It is he who is the eternal part in all creatures, whose essence is wisdom, who is immortal, unchangeable, destitute of limbs, of voice, of the (subtle) body, [#7]  (even) of touch, exceedingly pure; he is the universe, he is the highest goal; (he dwells in the middle of the body as) the Vishuvat day is (the middle of a Sattra-sacrifice); he, indeed, is (accessible to all) like a town intersected by many streets.

[#7]:  The Sutra contains a further description of the Paramātman.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
taṁ yō'nutiṣṭhētsarvatra prādhvaṁ cāsya sadācarēt । durdarśaṁ nipuṇaṁ yuktō yaḥ paśyētsa mōdēta viṣṭapē 8

**Bühler**—
8. He who meditates on him, and everywhere and always lives according to his (commandments), and who, full of devotion, sees him who is difficult to be seen and subtle, will rejoice in (his) heaven. [#8] 

[#8]:  Haradatta explains the word viṣṭap, 'heaven,' by 'pain-freed greatness,' apparently misled by a bad etymology. The heaven of the Ātman is, of course, liberation, that state where the individual soul becomes merged in the Brahman or Paramātman, which is pure essence, intelligence and joy.

### 23 adhyātmam

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
ātman paśyan sarvabhūtāni na muhyēccintayankaviḥ । ātmānaṁ caiva sarvatra yaḥ paśyētsa vai brahmā nākapr̥ṣṭhē virājati 1

**Bühler**—
1. That Brāhmaṇa, who is wise and recognises all creatures to be in the Ātman, who pondering (thereon) does not become bewildered, and who recognises the Ātman in every (created) thing, shines, indeed, in heaven.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
2. He, who is intelligence itself and subtler than the thread of the lotus-fibre, pervades the universe, and who, unchangeable and larger than the earth, contains the universe; he, who is different from the knowledge of this world, obtained by the senses and identical with its objects, possesses the highest (form consisting of absolute knowledge). From him, who divides himself, spring all (created) bodies. He is the primary cause, he is eternal, he is unchangeable. [#1] 

[#1]:  23. This Sūtra again contains a description of the Paramātman. The translation strictly follows the commentary, though the explanation, given in the latter, is open to objections.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
dōṣāṇāṁ tu vinirghātō yōgamūla iha jīvitē । nirhr̥tya bhūtadāhīyān kṣēmaṁ gacchati paṇḍitaḥ 3

**Bühler**—
3. But the eradication of the faults is brought about in this life by the means (called Yoga). A wise man who has eradicated the (faults) which destroy the creatures, obtains salvation.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
atha bhūtadāhīyāndōṣānudāhariṣyāmaḥ 4

**Bühler**—
4. Now we will enumerate the faults which tend to destroy the creatures.

**Bühler**—
5. (These are) anger, exultation, grumbling, covetousness, perplexity, doing injury, hypocrisy, lying, gluttony, calumny, envy, lust, secret hatred, neglect to keep the senses in subjection, neglect to concentrate the mind. The eradication of these (faults) takes place through the means of (salvation called) Yoga.

**Bühler**—
6. Freedom from anger, from exultation, from grumbling, from covetousness, from perplexity, from hypocrisy (and) hurtfulness; truthfulness, moderation in eating, silencing a slander, freedom from envy, self-denying liberality, avoiding to accept gifts, uprightness, affability, extinction of the passions, subjection of the senses, peace with all created beings, concentration (of the mind on the contemplation of the Ātman), regulation of one's conduct according to that of the Āryas, peacefulness and contentedness;--these (good qualities) have been settled by the agreement (of the wise) for all (the four) orders; he who, according to the precepts of the sacred law, practises these, enters the universal soul.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
kṣatriyaṁ hatvā gavāṁ sahasraṁ vairayātanārthaṁ dadyāt 1

**Bühler**—
1. He who has killed a Kṣatriya shall give a thousand cows (to Brāhmaṇas) for the expiation of his sin. [#1] 

[#1]:  24. Manu XI, 128; Yājñ. III, 266. Others explain the phrase vairayātanārtham, 'for the expiation of his sin,' thus: 'He, who is p. 79 slain by anybody, becomes, in dying, an enemy of his slayer (and thinks), "O that I might slay him in another life," for the removal of this enmity!'--Haradatta. I am strongly inclined to agree with the other commentator, and to translate vairayātanārtham, 'in order to remove the enmity.' I recognise in this fine a remnant of the law permitting compositions for murder which was in force in ancient Greece and among the Teutonic nations. With the explanation adopted by Haradatta, it is impossible to find a reasonable interpretation for prāyaścittirthaḥ, Sūtra 4. Haradatta, seduced by the parallel passage of Manu, takes it to be identical with vairayātanārtham. I propose to translate our Sūtra thus: 'He who has killed a Kṣatriya shall give a thousand cows (to the relations of the murdered man) in order to remove the enmity.' According to Baudhāyana I, 10. 19. 1 (compare Zeitschr. d. D. Morg. Ges., vol. 41, pp. 672-76; Festgruss an Roth, pp. 44-52), the cows are to be given to the king.

[#4]:  The same penances, i. e. those prescribed I, 9, 24-I, 9, 26, 4. According to Haradatta this Sūtra is intended to teach that women shall not perform the penances which follow. Others, however, are of opinion that it is given in order to indicate that the preceding Sūtras apply to women by an atideśa, and that, according to a Smārta principle, applicable to such cases, it may be inferred, that women are to perform one-half only of the penances prescribed for men.

**Bühler**—
1. And he shall take the foot of a bed instead of a staff and, proclaiming the name of his deed, he shall go about (saying), 'Who (gives) alms to the murderer of a Bhrūṇa?' Obtaining thus his livelihood in the village, he shall dwell in an empty house or under a tree, (knowing that) he is not allowed to have intercourse with Aryans. According to this rule he shall act until his last breath. He cannot be purified in this world. But (after death) his sin is taken away.

[#1]:  29. Haradatta gives, as an example, the case where a warrior saves the property of a traveller from thieves. If the traveller turns out to be a Brāhmaṇa, and the warrior did not know his caste before rescuing his property, his merit will be less than if he had rescued knowingly the property of a Brāhmaṇa.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
9. If they have begot sons, let them. say to them: 'Go out from amongst us, for thus the Āryas, (throwing the guilt) upon us, will receive you (amongst their number).' [#2] 

[#2]:  It is impossible to agree with Haradatta's explanation of the words to be addressed by Abhiśastas to their children. No Vedic license can excuse the use of the second person plural instead of the third. I propose the following: 'Go out from among us; for thus (leaving the guilt) to us, you will be received (as) Āryas.' it is, however, not improbable that our text is disfigured by several very old corruptions, compare Baudhāyana II, 1, 2, 18.

[#3]:  'In like manner a man who has lost his rights, (can) beget a son, who possesses the rights (of his caste). For the wife is also a cause (of the birth of the son), and she is guiltless.'--Haradatta.

**Bühler**—
12. Hārita declares that this is wrong.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
dadhidhānīsadharmā strī bhavati 13

**Bühler**—
13. A wife is similar to the vessel which contains the curds (for the sacrifice). [#4] 

[#4]:  The statements now following are those with which Āpastamba agrees. Those contained in Sūtras 8-11 are merely the pūrvapakṣa.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
yō hi dadhidhānyāmaprayataṁ paya ātacya manthati na tēna dharmakr̥tyaṁ kriyatē । ēvamaśuci śuklaṁ yannivartatē na tēna saha saṁprayōgō vidyatē 14

**Bühler**—
14. For if one makes impure milk curdle (by mixing it with whey and water) in a milk-vessel and stirs it, no sacrificial rite can be performed with (the curds produced from) that. Just so no intercourse can be allowed with the impure seed which comes (from an Abhiśasta).

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
17. But crimes causing impurity must be expiated, (when no particular penance is prescribed,) by performing the penance enjoined for crimes causing loss of caste during twelve months, or twelve half months, or twelve twelve-nights, or twelve se’nnights, or twelve times three days, or twelve days, or seven days, or three days, or one day.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
ityaśucikaranirvēṣō yathā karmābhyāsaḥ 18

**Bühler**—
18. Thus acts causing impurity must be expiated according to the manner in which the (sinful) act has been committed (whether intentionally or unintentionally).

**Bühler**—
24. (The foolish decision) of a person who decides wrongly destroys his ancestors and his future happiness, it harms his children, cattle, and house. 'Oh Dharmaprahrāda, (this deed belongs) not to Kumālana!' thus decided Death, weeping, the question (addressed to him by the Ṛṣi). [#6] 

[#6]:  Haradatta tells the story to which the second half of the verse alludes, in the following manner: 'A certain Ṛṣi had two pupils, called Dharmaprahrāda and Kumālana. Once they brought from the forest two great bundles of firewood and threw them negligently into their teacher's house, without looking. One of the bundles struck the teacher's little son so that he died. Then the teacher asked his two pupils, "Which of you two has killed him?" Both answered, "Not I, not I." Hereupon the teacher, being unable to (come to a decision in order to) send away, the sinner and to keep the innocent one, called Death, and asked him, "Which of the two has killed the boy?" Then Death, finding himself involved in a difficult law-question, began to weep, and p. 99 giving his decision, said, "Oh Dharmaprahrāda, not to Kumālana (the dative has the sense of the genitive), this sin is none of Kumālana's!" Instead of declaring, "Dharmaprahrāda, thou hast done this,' he said, "The other did not do it." Still from the circumstances of the case it appeared that the meaning of the answer was, "The other has done it." "This was the decision which he gave crying."'--The reading of the text rendered in the translation is, dharmaprahrāda na kumālanāya.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
pāṇigrahaṇādadhi gr̥hamēdhinōrvratam 1

**Bühler**—
1. After marriage the rites prescribed for a householder and his wife (must be performed). [#1] 

[#1]:  1. According to Haradatta, this rule is intended to refute the opinion of those who hold that the sacred household-fire may be kept, and the prescribed offerings therein may be performed, either from the time of the marriage, or after the division of the family estate. He also states that the use of the dual gṛhamedhinoḥ indicates that husband and wife must perform the rites conjointly. Manu III, 67.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
kālayōrbhōjanam 2

**Bühler**—
2. He shall eat at the two (appointed) times, (morning and evening) [#2] 

[#2]:  Haradatta thinks that this Sūtra is intended to prevent householders from having more than two meals a day, and to keep them from gluttony. Others are of opinion that its object is to keep householders from excessive fasting, and to make them perform the Prāṇāgnihotra at either meal. At the Prāṇāgnihotra the sacrificer eats five mouthfuls invoking successively, whilst he p. 100 eats, the five vital airs. At the first mouthful he says, 'To Prāṇa svāhā;' at the second, 'To Apāna svāhā,' &c.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
5. To eat once (on those days in the morning) that also is called fasting. [#3] 

[#3]:  Āśv. Gṛ. Sū. I, 10, 2.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
6. And they may eat (at that meal) until they are quite satisfied.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
yaccainayōḥ priyaṁ syāt tad ētasminn ahani bhuñjīyātām 7

**Bühler**—
7. And on (the anniversary of) that (wedding)-day they may eat that food of which they are fond. [#4] 

[#4]:  Haradatta holds that the words 'on that day' do not refer to the days of the new and full moon, the Parvan-days, mentioned in Sūtra 4. His reasons are, first, that the permission to eat food, of which the householder may be particularly fond, has already been given in Sūtra 6, by the term tṛpiḥ, 'satisfaction'; and, secondly, that the singular 'on this day' does not agree with the plural 'on the Parvan-days.' Hence he comes to the conclusion that the words 'on that day' must refer to the wedding-day, mentioned in Sūtra 1, as well as to its anniversary. Haradatta is, probably, right in his explanation, though the reasons adduced here are very weak. A stronger reason for detaching this Sūtra from Sūtra 4 will be brought forward below, under Sūtra 11. Mahādeva, the commentator of the Hiraṇyakeśidharma, adopts the view rejected by Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

8. And (on the night of that day) they shall sleep on the ground (on a raised heap of earth). [#5]

śvōbhūtē sthālīpākaḥ 10

**Bühler**—
10. And on the day after (that day) a Sthālīpāka must be offered. [#6] 

[#6]:  A Sthālīpāka is an offering at which rice cooked in a pot, sthālī, is offered in the fire. A full description of this kind of sacrifice occurs, Āśv. Gṛ. Sū. I, 10, 1 seq.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tasyōpacāraḥ pārvaṇēna vyākhyātaḥ 11

**Bühler**—
11. The manner in which that offering must be [#7]  performed has been declared by (the description of the Sthālīpāka) to be performed on the days of the new and full moon (the Pārvaṇa).

[#7]:  The Pārvaṇa Sthālīpāka has been described by Āpastamba p. 101 in the Gṛhya-sūtra, III, 7. Again, Haradatta returns to the question whether the words on that day (Sūtra 7) refer to the Parvan-days, or the marriage-day and its anniversaries. He now adds, in favour of the latter view, that the word Pārvaṇena, 'by the rite to be performed on Parvan-days,' by which the Sthālīpāka on Parvan-days is intended, clearly proves the impossibility to refer he preceding rules to the Parvan-days. He adds that some, nevertheless, adopt the explanation rejected by himself.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
nityaṁ lōka upadiśanti 12

**Bühler**—
12. And they declare (that this rite which is known) amongst the people (must be performed) every (year). [#8] 

[#8]:  They, i.e. the Śiṣṭas, those learned in the law. 'Another commentator says, the rite which will be taught (in the following Sūtra), and which is known from the usage of the learned, is constant, i.e. must be performed in every case. That it is what the "learned" declare.'--Haradatta. The latter explanation of the Sūtra is adopted by Mahādeva.

**Bühler**—
15. The water-vessels in the house shall never be empty; that is the duty to be observed by the householder and his wife. [#10] 

[#10]:  Haradatta states that the object of the repetition of the words 'the householder and his wife' is to show that they themselves must fill the water-vessels, and not employ others for this purpose. He adds that, according to another commentator, the object of the repetition is to show that Sūtras 13 and 14 apply not only to householders, but also to students, and that hence students, when they offer the daily oblations of sacred fuel (above, I, 1, 4, 14 seq.), should also perform the rites taught in the preceding Sūtras.

**Bühler**—
3. Afterwards when (a man who has fulfilled his duties) returns to this world, he obtains, by virtue of a remainder of merit, birth in a distinguished family, beauty of form, beauty of complexion, strength, aptitude for learning, wisdom, wealth, and the gift of fulfilling the laws of his (caste and order). Therefore in both worlds he dwells in happiness, (rolling) like a wheel (from the one to the other).

[#1]:  2. Manu XII, 55; Yājñ. III, 206, 207. A Paulkasa is said to be the offspring of a Niṣāda and a Kṣatriya woman. See the Pet. Dict. s.v. A Vaiṇa is a rope-dancer, or equilibrist.

[#9]:  It is a disputed point with the commentators whether every Brāhmaṇa may offer the Vaiśvadeva in the common kitchen-fire, or those persons only who do not keep a sacred domestic fire. The six Mantras, which are given Taitt. Ār. X, 67, 1, are: 1. Agnaye svāhā, 'to Agni svāhā'; 2. Somāya svāhā, 'to Soma svāhā'; 3. Viśvebhyo devebhyaḥ svāhā, 'to all the gods svāhā'; 4. Dhruvāya bhūmaya svāhā, 'to Dhruva Bhūma svāhā'; 5. Dhruvakṣitaye svāhā, 'to Dhruvakṣiti svāhā'; 6. Acyutakṣitaye svāhā, 'to Acyutakṣiti svāhā.' Haradatta adds that some add a seventh formula, addressed to Agni sviṣṭakṛt, 'to the fire which causes the proper performance of the sacrifice,' while others leave out the second Mantra and give that addressed to Agni sviṣṭakṛt the sixth place. This latter is the order given in the Calcutta edition of the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.

[#12]:  The first six offerings constitute the Devayajña or Vaiśvadeva, which is offered in the fire. Now follow the Bali-offerings, which are merely placed on the ground. 'Behind the fire' means to the east of the fire'; for the sacrificer must face the east.

[#3]:  Haradatta gives two explanations of the word Brahmasadana, 'the seat of Brahman.' According to some, it is an architectural term, designating the centre of the house; according to others, it denotes the place where, at the time of the burnt-oblations, the Brahman or superintending priest is seated, i.e. a spot to the south of the sacred fire.

[#4]:  Balis and water for the Manes are placed or poured into the palm of the hand and thrown out between the thumb and forefinger. That part of the palm is, therefore, sometimes called 'the tīrtha sacred to the Manes.' See Manu II, 39.

The Mantra is, 'To those beings which, being servants of Vituda, roam about day and night, desiring a Bali-offering, I offer this Bali, desirous of prosperity. May the Lord of prosperity grant me prosperity, svāhā. Haradatta adds, that according to another commentator, no other Bali but this is to be offered in the evening, and that some modify the Mantra for each occasion, offering the Bali in the morning to the Bhūtas that roam about during the day,' and in the evening 'to the night-walkers.' Compare for the whole section Manu III, 90-92; Yājñ. I, 102-104.

This irregularity would disappear if tṛṇā, the Vedic form of the nom. ace. plural, were read for tṛṇāni, and it seems to me not improbable that tṛṇāni is a correction made by a Pandit who valued grammatical correctness higher than correctness of metre.

From here down to II, 3, 6, 2, Āpastamba again treats of the duties of students and teachers, a subject which appears to have in his eyes a greater importance than any other. The rules given now apply chiefly to householders. It would seem that they have been inserted in this particular place, because the reception of a former teacher is to be described II, 3, 5, 4-11, and that of a 'learned guest' II, 3, 6, 3 seq.

1. On the day on which, beginning the study of the whole sacred science, the Upaniṣads (and the rest, he performs the Upākarma in the morning) he shall not study (at night). [#1] 

[#1]:  5. This rule refers to the Upākarma, to be performed yearly by householders. In our days, too, the custom is observed, and the whole Brahminical community change on this occasion their Jenvīs or sacrificial cords in the month of Srāvaṇa. The adherents of the various Śākhās of the Vedas, however, perform the ceremony on different days. According to Haradatta, the Upaniṣads are named, in order to show that they are of the highest importance. See also Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa X, 3, 5, 12.

2. And he shall not leave his teacher at once after having studied (the Veda and having returned home) [#2] 

[#2]:  Others consider that this Sūtra refers to the annual Upākarma of the householder. In that case the translation would be, 'And after having performed the Upākarma,' &c. Probably Āpastamba means to give a general rule, applicable both to householders and to students who have returned home.

[#4]:  According to Haradatta, the repetition of the word ācāryam, 'the teacher,' in this Sūtra, indicates that the rule holds good not only when the teacher comes as a guest to his former pupil, but on every occasion when he receives water for sipping.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

The second sentence refers to the story that Yājñavalkya vomited the Black Yajur-veda, and his fellow-students, becoming partridges, picked it up.

[#3]:  The object of this Sūtra is to complete the definition of the term 'guest' to be given in the following Sūtra. In my translation I have followed Haradatta's gloss. The literal sense of Āpastamba's words is,. 'He who, observing the law, has studied one recension of each (of the four) Vedas, becomes a Śrotriya.' Haradatta says this definition would be contrary to the current acceptation of the term. That argument proves, however, nothing for Āpastamba's times.

**Bühler**—
1. This reception of guests is an everlasting (Śrauta)-sacrifice offered by the householder to Prajāpati. [#1]

**Bühler**—
2. The fire in the stomach of the guest (represents) the Āhavanīya, (the sacred fire) in the house of the host represents the Gārhapatya, the fire at which the food for the guest is cooked (represents) the fire used for cooking the sacrificial viands (the Dakṣiṇāgni). [#2] 

[#2]:  in the first Sūtra the reception of guests had been compared to an everlasting Vedic sacrifice. This analog is traced further in detail in this Sūtra. One of the chief characteristics of a Vedic sacrifice is the vitāna, or the use of three sacred fires. Hence Āpastamba shows that three fires also are used in offering hospitality to guests.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
ūrjaṁ puṣṭiṁ prajāṁ paśūniṣṭāpūrtamiti gr̥hāṇāmaśnāti yaḥ pūrvō'tithēraśnāti 3

[#4]:  The morning, midday, and evening offerings offered at the great Vedic sacrifices are called Savanas. The object of this Sūtra is to prescribe the hospitable reception of guests at a times of the day, and to further describe the similarity of a guest-offering to a Vedic sacrifice.

[#9]:  An Agnihotrin is a Brāhmaṇa who offers certain daily burnt offerings called Agnihotra. The translation of the last clause renders tarpayantu, the reading of the Atharva-veda.

[#11]:  Haradatta states that the Brāhmaṇa mentioned in the text is the Āharvaṇa-brāhmaṇa. See Atharva-veda. XV, 11-12.

[#7]:  A wife who assists at the kindling of the fires for any sacrificial rite, becomes connected with that rite like any priest, and in that rite no other woman can take her place. Hence in the case of an Agnihotra, which lasts during the performer's lifetime, or at least as long as be is a householder, the performer cannot take another principal wife after be once has begun his sacrifice. If the wife of an Agnihotrin dies, he must marry again, and also kindle his fires afresh. Manu V, 167, 168; Yājñ. I 80.

15. He shall not give his daughter to a man belonging to the same family (Gotra), [#8] 

[#8]:  The term Gotra corresponds to the Latin Gens. It may be of two kinds, Vaidika for Brāhmaṇas and Laukika, 'worldly', for men of other castes. In the first case it denotes 'persons descended from the same Ṛṣi;' in the second, 'persons distinguished by the same family name, or known to be descended from the same ancestor.' In our days Brāhmaṇas also have Laukika Gotras, which form subdivisions of the very large Vedic Gotras. Regarding the Vaidika Gotras, see Max Müller's History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, pp. 379-390, and particularly p. 387. Manu III, 5; Yājñ. I, 33; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 75 seq.

[#9]:  The term yonisambandha, 'related (within six degrees),' corresponds to the more common Sapiṇḍa of Manu, Yājñavalkya, and others; see the definitions given below, II, 6, 15, 2. In Āpastamba's terminology Sapiṇḍa has probably a more restricted sense. It seems very doubtful whether Haradatta's explanation of ka, translated by 'or,' is correct, and whether his interpolation of 'the father's' ought to be admitted. Probably Sūtra 15 refers to the father's side, and Sūtra 16 to the mother's side.

[#2]:  Another (commentator) says, 'Neither of the parents shall pass them over at (the distribution of) the heritage. Both (parents) must leave their property to them.'--Haradatta. The text of the Sūtra admits of either explanation.

7. Now they quote also (the following Gāthā from the Veda): '(Having considered myself) formerly a father, I shall not now allow (any longer) my wives (to be approached by other men), since they have declared that a son belongs to the begetter in the world of Yama. The giver of the seed carries off the son after death in Yama's world; therefore they guard [#4]  their wives, fearing the seed of strangers. Carefully watch over (the procreation of) your children, lest stranger seed be sown on your soil. In the next world the son belongs to the begetter, an (imprudent) husband makes the (begetting of) children vain (for himself).'

[#4]:  According to Haradatta this Gāthā gives the sentiments of a husband who neglected to watch his wives, and who had heard from those learned in the law that the sons or his unfaithful wives would in the next world belong to their natural fathers, and that be would not derive any spiritual benefit from their oblations. He adds that this verse does not refer to or prevent the appointment of a eunuch's wife or of a childless widow to a relation. He also quotes a passage from the Śrauta-sūtra 1, 9, 7, in which the dvipitā, 'the son of two fathers,' is mentioned. But Haradatta's view cannot be reconciled with the statements made below, II, 10, 27, 2-7, p. 132 where the Niyoga, is plainly forbidden. Baudhāyana, who (II, 2, 3, 34) quotes the same Gāthā, reads in the first line the vocative 'janaka' instead of the nominative 'janakaḥ,' and in the fifth line 'pare bījāni' instead of 'parabījāni.' The commentator Govindasvāmin adds that the verses are addressed by the Ṛṣi Aupajaṅghani to king Janaka of Videha. The translation of the first line must therefore run thus: 'O Janaka, now I am jealous of my wives, (though I was) not so formerly,' &c. Baudhāyana's readings are probably the older ones, and Govindasvāmin's explanation the right one. See also Colebrooke, Digest, Book V, Text ccli.

11. The gift (or acceptance of a child) and the right to sell (or buy) a child are not recognised. [#5] 

[#5]:  Haradatta thinks that, as most other Smṛtis enumerate the adopted son, and 'the son bought' in their lists of substitutes for lawful sons of the body, Āpastamba's rule can refer only to the gift or sale of an eldest son, or to the gift or sale of a child effected by a woman. Though it is possible that he may be right in his interpretation, it remains a remarkable fact that Āpastamba does not mention the 'twelve kinds of sons,' which are known to other Smṛtis.

**Bühler**—
12. It is declared in the Veda that at the time of marriage a gift, for (the fulfilment of) his wishes, should be made (by the bridegroom) to the father [#6]  of the bride, in order to fulfil the law. 'Therefore he should give a hundred (cows) besides a chariot; that (gift) he should make bootless (by returning it to the giver).' In reference to those (marriage-rites), the word 'sale' (which occurs in some Smṛtis is only used as) a metaphorical expression; for the union (of the husband and wife) is effected through the law.

[#6]:  This Sūtra seems to be directed against Vasiṣṭha I, 36.

1. He should, during his lifetime, divide his wealth equally amongst his sons, excepting the eunuch, the mad man, and the outcast. [#1] 

[#1]:  14. The last Sūtra of Khaṇḍa 13 and the first of Khaṇḍa 14 are quoted by Colebrooke, Digest, Book V, Text xlii, and Mitākṣarā, Chap. I, Sect. iii, Par. 6. Colebrooke translates jīvan, 'during his lifetime,' by 'who makes a partition during his lifetime.' I think that this is not quite correct, and that Āpastamba intends to exhort householders to make a division during their lifetime, as later they ought to become ascetics or hermits. Haradatta introduces into his commentary on this Sūtra the whole chapter on the division of a father's estate amongst his sons, supplementing Āpastamba's short rule by the texts of other lawyers. No doubt, Āpastamba means to lay down, in these and the following Sūtras, only the leading principles of the law of inheritance, and he intends that the remaining particulars should be supplied from the law of custom or other Smṛtis.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
putrābhāvē yaḥ pratyāsannaḥ sapiṇḍaḥ 2

**Bühler**—
2. On failure of sons the nearest Sapiṇḍa (takes the inheritance). [#2] 

[#2]:  Haradatta gives in his commentary a full summary of the rules on the succession of remoter relations. One point only deserves special mention. He declares that it is the opinion of Āpastamba, that widows cannot inherit. In this he is probably right, as Āpastamba does not mention them, and the use of the p. 134 masculine singular 'sapiṇḍaḥ' in the text precludes the possibility of including them under that collective term. It seems to me certain, that Āpastamba, like Baudhāyana, considered women, especially widows, unfit to inherit.

[#6]:  '"Black produce of the earth," i.e. black grain, or according to others black iron.'--Haradatta. Compare for this and the following Sūtras Colebrooke, Mitākṣarā, Chap. I, Sect. iii, Par. 6, and Digest, Book V, Text xlviii.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
rathaḥ pituḥ parībhāṇḍaṁ ca gr̥hē 8

**Bühler**—
8. The chariot and the furniture in the house are the father's (share). [#7] 

[#7]:  The translation given above agrees with what I now recognise to be Haradatta's explanation, and with Colebrooke, Mitākṣarā, Chap. I, Sect. iii, Par. 6. Both the P. U. and Mr. U. MSS. of the Ujjvalā read rathaḥ pituraṃśo gṛhe yatparibhāṇḍam upakaraṇam pīṭhādi tadapi, 'the chariot (is) the father's share; the furniture which (is) in the house, that also.' To this reading Mahādeva's Ujjvalā on the Hiraṇyakeśi Sūtra points likewise, which gives pītur antaḥ. The N. U. MS. of the Ujjvalā, according to which p. 135 I made the translation given in the Appendix to West and Bühler's Digest (1st edition), leaves out the word aṃśaḥ, and therefore makes it necessary to combine this Sūtra, with the preceding one, and to translate, 'The father's chariot and the furniture in the house (are) also (the share of the eldest).' This latter translation agrees nearly with that given by Colebrooke, Digest, Book V, Text xlviii, where this and the preceding Sūtra have been joined; but the chariot is not mentioned. A further variation in the interpretation of this Sūtra occurs in Colebrooke's Digest, Book V, Text lxxxix, and Mitākṣarā, loc. cit., where the words 'the furniture in the house' are joined with Sūtra 9, and the furniture is declared to be the wife's share. Considering that Sūtra 9 is again quoted in Colebrooke's Digest, Book V, Text cccclxxii, and is not joined with the latter part of Sūtra 8, it is not too much to say that Jagannātha has not shown any greater accuracy than his brethren usually do.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
alaṁkārō bhāryāyā jñātidhanaṁ cētyēkē 9

**Bühler**—
9. According to some, the share of the wife consists of her ornaments, and the wealth (which she may have received) from her relations. [#8] 

[#8]:  The Mitākṣarā, loc. cit., apparently takes the words 'according to some' as referring only, to property received from relations. I follow Haradatta. The former interpretation is, however, admissible, if the Sūtra is split into two.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

12. Now the Veda declares also in conformity with (the rule in favour of the eldest son) alone: They distinguish the eldest by (a larger share of) the heritage. [#11] 

[#11]:  'Athāpi (now also) means "and certainly." They distinguish, they set apart the eldest son by wealth: this has been declared in the Veda in conformity with (the rule regarding) one (heir, Sūtra 6). He denies (Sūtra 13) that a passage also, which p. 136 agrees with the statement that the eldest son alone inherits, is found in the Veda.'--Haradatta. See Taittirīyā Saṃhitā II, 5, 2, 7.

**Bühler**—
13. (But to this plea in favour of the eldest I answer): Now those who are acquainted with the interpretation of the law declare a statement of facts not to be a rule, as for instance (the following): 'Therefore amongst cattle, goats and sheep walk together;' (or the following), 'Therefore the face of a learned Brāhmaṇa (a Snātaka) is, as it were, resplendent;' (or), 'A Brāhmaṇa who has studied the Vedas (a Śrotriya) and a he-goat evince the strongest sexual desires.' [#12] 

[#12]:  Those who are acquainted with the interpretation of the law are the Mimāṃsakas. The translation of the second Vedic passage is by no means certain, as the root ribh, translated by 'to be resplendent,' usually means 'to give a sound.' Haradatta thinks that Āpastamba means to show that the passage 'Manu divided his wealth among his sons' is likewise merely a statement of facts, and cannot be considered a rule. This is probably erroneous, as Sūtras 10 and 11 distinctly state, that the practice to allow the eldest alone to inherit, is forbidden by the abovementioned passage of the Veda.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
sarvē hi dharmayuktā bhāginaḥ 14

[#13]:  Compare for this Sūtra and the following one Colebrooke's Digest, Book V, Text cccxv. The translation of pratipādayati, 'expends,' by 'gains,' which is also proposed by Jagannātha, is against Āpastamba's usage, see II, 5, 11, 17, and below, II, 8, 20, 19.

According to Haradatta those who know the correct interpretation, declare that the word' women' denotes in this Sūtra 'the Smṛtis.' But I fear these learned interpreters will find few adherents among those who pay attention to the last Sūtra of this work.

The meaning of the Sūtra, therefore, is, 'If anybody has been forced by poverty to mix his rice or Ḍāl with kulittha or similar bad food, he cannot offer a burnt-oblation at the Vaiśvadeva ceremony with that. He must observe the rule, given in the following Sūtra.

[#2]:  The reading 'niḥśreyasā ka' apparently has given great trouble to the commentators. Their explanations are, however, grammatically impossible. The right one is to take 'niḥśreyasā as a Vedic instrumental, for niḥśreyasena, which may designate the 'reason'. If the dative is read, the sense remains the same.

**Bühler**—
8. The food eaten (at a sacrifice) by persons related to the giver is, indeed, a gift offered to the goblins. It reaches neither the Manes nor the [#4]  gods. Losing its power (to procure heaven), it errs about in this world as a cow that has lost its calf runs into a strange stable.

The following persons defile the company if they are invited to a funeral-sacrifice, viz. a leper, a bald man, the violator of another man's bed, the son of a Brāhmaṇa who follows the profession of a Kṣatriya, and the son of (a Brāhmaṇa who by marrying first a Śūdra wife had himself become) a Śūdra, born from a Brāhmaṇa woman. [#11] 

[#11]:  Manu III, 152-166, and particularly 153 and 154 Yājñ. I. 222-224. Haradatta's explanation of the word 'Śūdra' by 'a Brāhmaṇa who has become a Śūdra' is probably not because the son of a real Śūdra and of a Brāhmaṇa female is a Kaṇḍāla, and has been disposed of by the preceding Sūtra.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

**Bühler**—
22. The following persons sanctify the company if they eat at a funeral-sacrifice, viz. one who has studied the three verses of the Veda containing the word 'Madhu,' each three times; one who has studied the part of the Veda containing the word 'Suparṇa' three times; a Triṇāciketa; one who has studied the Mantras required for the four sacrifices (called Aśvamedha, Puruṣamedha, Sarvamedha, and Pitṛmedha); one who keeps five fires; one who knows the Sāman called Jyeṣṭha; one who fulfils the duty of daily study; the son of one who has studied and is able to teach the whole Veda with its Aṅgas, and a Śrotriya. [#12] 

[#12]:  Compare Manu III, 185, 186; Yājñ. I, 219-221. The three verses to be known by a Trimadhu are, Madhu vātā ṛtāyate, &c., which occur both in the Taitt. Saṃh. and in the Taitt. Ār. The explanation of Trisuparṇa is not certain. Haradatta thinks that it may mean either a person who knows the three verses Catushkapardā yuvatiḥ supeśā, &c., Taittirīya-brāhmaṇa I, 2, 1, 27, &c., or one who knows the three Anuvākas from the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka X, 48-50, beginning, Brahmametu mām, &c. The word 'Triṇāciketa' has three explanations:--a. A person who knows the Nāciketa-fire according to the Taittirīyaka, Kaṭhavallī, and the Śatapatha, i.e. has studied the portions on the Nāciketa-fire in these three books. b. A person who has thrice kindled the Nāciketa-fire. c. A person who has studied the Anuvāka, called Virajas. Caturmedha may also mean 'one who has performed the four sacrifices' enumerated above.

[#2] 

[#2]:  The reason why the constellation Tiṣya has been chosen for this rite seems to be that Tiṣya has another name, Puṣya, i.e. 'prosperous'. This sacrifice is to begin on the Tiṣya-day of the month called Taiṣa or Pauṣa (December-January), and to continue for one year.

**Bühler**—
24. If he obtains fresh grain, he shall throw away the old (store). [#10] 

[#10]:  Manu VI, 15; Yājñ. III, 47.

### 23 gr̥hastha-śrēṣṭhatā

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
bhūyāṁsaṁ vā niyamam icchann  
anvaham ēva pātrēṇa sāyaṁ prātar artham āharēt 1

**Bühler**—
1. If he desires (to perform) very great austerities, he (shall not make a hoard of grain, but) collect food every day only, morning and evening, in his vessel. [#1] 

[#1]:  23. The following rules apply to a solitary hermit.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tatō mūlaiḥ phalaiḥ parṇais tr̥ṇair iti vartayaṁś carēd  
antataḥ pravr̥ttāni +++(=svayampatitāni)+++,  
tatō'pō vāyum ākāśam  
ity abhiniśrayēt।  
tēṣāmuttara uttaraḥ saṁyōgaḥ phalatō viśiṣṭaḥ 2

**Bühler**—
2. Afterwards he shall wander about, sustaining his life with roots, fruits, leaves, and grass (which he [#2]  collects). Finally (he shall content himself with) what has become detached spontaneously. Then he shall live on water, then on air, (and finally) upon ether. Each succeeding mode of subsistence procures greater rewards.

[#2]:  These Sūtras are repeated in order to show that, according to, the opinion of those who allow hermits to live with their families, the end should be the same.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
atha purāṇē ślōkāv udāharanti 3

**Bühler**—
3. Now they quote (the following) two verses from a Purāṇa: [#3] 

[#3]:  'The "orders" have been described. Now, giving conflicting opinions, he discusses which of them is the most important.'--Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
aṣṭāśīti-sahasrāṇi yē  
prajām īśira +++(=abhyanandan)+++ r̥rṣayaḥ ।  
dakṣiṇēnāryamṇaḥ panthānaṁ  
tē śmaśānāni bhējirē 4

**Bühler**—
4. Those eighty thousand sages who desired offspring passed to the south by Aryaman's road and obtained burial-grounds. [#4] 

[#4]:  This verse and the next are intended to disparage the order of householders. Haradatta explains 'burial-grounds' by 'new births which lead to new deaths;' but see below, Sūtra 10. See also Yājñ. III, 186-187.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
aṣṭāśītisahasrāṇi yē prajāṁ nēṣirarṣayaḥ ।  
uttarēṇāryamṇaḥ panthānaṁ tē'mr̥tatvaṁ hi kalpatē 5

**Bühler**—
5. Those eighty thousand sages who desired no offspring passed by Aryaman's road to the north and obtained immortality.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
ityūrdhvarētasāṁ +++(=gr̥hasthētarēṣām)+++ praśaṁsā 6

**Bühler**—
6. Thus are praised those who keep the vow of chastity.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
athāpi saṁkalpa-siddhayō +++(=saṅkalpata ēva siddhiḥ)+++ bhavanti 7

**Bühler**—
7. Now they accomplish also their wishes merely by conceiving them,

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
yathā varṣaṁ, prajā-dānaṁ,  
dūrē darśanaṁ, manō-javatā,  
yaccānyad ēvaṁ yuktam 8

**Bühler**—
8. For instance, (the desire to procure) rain, to bestow children, second-sight, to move quick as thought, and other (desires) of this description.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tasmāc chrutitaḥ, pratyakṣa-phalatvāc ca  
viśiṣṭān āśramān ētān ēkē bruvatē 9

**Bühler**—
9. Therefore on account of (passages) of the revealed texts, and on account of the visible results, some declare these orders (of men keeping the vow of chastity to be) the most excellent.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
traividya-vr̥ddhānāṁ tu  
vēdāḥ pramāṇam  
iti niṣṭhā।  
tatra yāni śrūyantē  
vrīhi-yava-paśv-ājya-payaḥ-kapāla-patnī-saṁbandhāny  
uccair nīcaiḥ kāryam iti  
tair viruddha ācārō 'pramāṇam iti manyantē 10

**Bühler**—
10. But (to this we answer): It is the firm opinion of those who are well versed in the threefold sacred learning, that the Vedas are the highest authority. They consider that the (rites) which are ordered there to be performed with rice, yava, animals, clarified butter, milk, potsherds, (in conjunction) with a wife, (and accompanied) by loud or muttered (Mantras), must be performed, and that (hence) a rule of conduct which is opposed to these (rites) is of no authority.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
yat tu śmaśānam ucyatē  
+++("dakṣiṇēnāryamṇaḥ panthānaṁ tē śmaśānāni bhējirē" ityasmin)+++  
nānā-karmaṇām ēṣō'ntē puruṣa-saṁskārō vidhīyatē 11

**Bühler**—
11. But by the term burial-ground (in the text above given) it is intended to ordain the last rites for those who have performed many sacrifices, (and not to mean that dead householders become demons and haunt burial-grounds.) [#5] 

[#5]:  The Sūtra is intended to remove the blame thrown on the order of householders by the verse quoted. Haradatta seems to have forgotten his former explanation of Śmaśānāni.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tataḥ param anantyaṁ phalaṁ svargya-śabdaṁ śrūyatē 12

**Bühler**—
12. The revealed texts declare that after (the burial follows) a reward without end, which is designated by the term 'heavenly bliss.'

### 24 gr̥hastha-śrēṣṭhatā

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
athāpyasya prajātim  
amr̥tam āmnāya āha । prajāmanu prajāyasē tadu tē martyāmr̥tamiti 1

**Bühler**—
1. Now the Veda declares also one's offspring to be immortality (in this verse): 'In thy offspring thou art born again, that, mortal, is thy immortality.'

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
athāpi - sa ēvāyaṁ virūḍhaḥ pr̥thak pratyakṣēṇōpalabhyatē dr̥śyatē cāpi sārūpyaṁ dēhatvamēvānyat 2

**Bühler**—
2. Now it can also be perceived by the senses that the (father) has been reproduced separately (in the son); for the likeness (of a father and of a son) is even visible, only (their) bodies are different.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tē śiṣṭēṣu karmasu vartamānāḥ pūrvēṣāṁ sāṁparāyēṇa kīrtiṁ svargaṁ ca vardhayanti 3

**Bühler**—
3. 'These (sons) who live, fulfilling the rites taught (in the Veda), increase the fame and heavenly bliss of their departed ancestors.'

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
ēvamavarō'varaḥ parēṣām +++(=pūrvikāṇām)+++ 4

**Bühler**—
4. 'In this manner each succeeding (generation increases the fame and heavenly bliss) of the preceding ones.'

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
ā bhūtasaṁplavāt tē svargajitaḥ 5

**Bühler**—
5. 'They (the ancestors) live in heaven until the (next) general destruction of created things.'

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
punaḥ sargē bījārthā bhavantīti bhaviṣyatpurāṇē 6

**Bühler**—
6. At the new creation (of, the world) they become the seed. That has been declared in the Bhaviṣyatpurāṇa. [#1] 

[#1]:  24. 'They become the seed,' i.e. 'The Prajāpatis.'

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
athāpi prajāpatērvacanam 7

**Bühler**—
7. Now Prajāpati also says,

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
trayīṁ vidyāṁ brahmacaryaṁ prajātiṁ śraddhāṁ tapō yajñamanupradānam । ya ētāni kurvatē tairit saha +++(vayam prajāpatayaḥ)+++ smō, rajō bhūtvā dhvaṁsatē 'nyat praśaṁsann iti 8

**Bühler**—
8. 'Those dwell with us who fulfil the following (duties): the study of the three Vedas, the studentship, the procreation of children, faith, religious austerities, sacrifices, and the giving of gifts. He who praises other (duties), becomes dust and peṛṣes.' [#2] 

[#2]:  'Other (duties), i.e. the order of ascetics and the like.'--Haradatta.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tatra yē pāpakr̥tasta ēva dhvaṁsanti yathā parṇaṁ vanaspatērna parānhiṁsanti 9

**Bühler**—
9. Those among these (sons) who commit sin, peṛṣ alone, just as the leaf of a tree (which has been attacked by worms falls without injuring its branch or tree). They do not hurt their ancestors.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
nāsyāsmiṁl lōkē karmabhiḥ saṁbandhō vidyatē tathā parasminkarmaphalaiḥ 10

**Bühler**—
10. (For) the (ancestor) has no connection with the acts committed (by his descendant) in this world, nor with their results in the next.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tadētēna vēditavyam 11

**Bühler**—
11. (The truth of) that may be known by the following (reason):

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
prajāpatērr̥ṣīṇāmiti sargō'yam 12

**Bühler**—
12. This creation (is the work) of Prajāpati and of the sages.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
tatra yē puṇyakr̥tas tēṣāṁ prakr̥tayaḥ parā jvalantya +++(= tārārūpēṇa)+++ upalabhyantē 13

**Bühler**—
13. The bodies of those (sages) who stay there (in heaven) on account of their merits appear visibly most excellent and brilliant (as, for instance, the constellation of the seven Ṛṣis). [#3] 

[#3]:  As the Ṛṣis have not lost heaven through the sins of their sons, the dogma according to which ancestors lose heaven through the sins of their sons, must be false.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
syāt tu karmāvayavēna tapasā vā kaścit saśarīrō 'nvantaṁ lōkaṁ jayati, saṅkalpasiddhiś ca syān - na tu taj jyaiṣṭhyam āśramāṇām 14

**Bühler**—
14. But even though some (ascetic), whilst still [#4]  in the body, may gain heaven through a portion of (the merit acquired by his former) works or through austerities, and though he may. accomplish (his objects) by his mere wish, still this is no reason to place one order before the other.

[#4]:  Āpastamba's own opinion is apparently against pure asceticism.

### 25 rājadharmāḥ

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
vyākhyātāḥ sarvavarṇānāṁ sādhāraṇavaiśēṣikā dharmāḥ । rājñastu viśēṣādvakṣyāmaḥ 1

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—

9. The (king) shall make them collect the lawful taxes (śulka). [#8] 

[#8]:  According to Haradatta, who quotes Gautama in his commentary, the śulka is the 1/20th part of a merchant's gains. On account of the Sūtras immediately following, it is, however, more probable that the term is here used as a synonym of 'kara,' and includes all taxes. 'Lawful' taxes are, of course, those sanctioned by custom and approved of by the Smṛtis.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
akaraḥ śrōtriyaḥ 10

**Bühler**—

buddhipūrvaṁ tu duṣṭabhāvō daṇḍyaḥ 19

**Bühler**—
19. But he does it intentionally with a bad purpose, he must be fined. [#13] 

[#13]:  'The punishment must be proportionate to his property and the greatness of his offence. The term "with a bad purpose" is added, because he who has been sent by his teacher (to such a place) should not be punished.'--Haradatta. Manu VIII, 354; Yājñ. II, 284.

**mūla-prastutiḥ**—
saṁnipātē vr̥ttē śiśnacchēdanaṁ savr̥ṣaṇasya 20

**Bühler**—
2. (A husband) shall not make over his (wife), who occupies the position of a 'gentilis,' to others (than to his 'gentiles'), in order to cause children to be begot for himself. [#1]

[#1]:  28. This Sūtra shows that the system of leasing land against a certain share of the crops, which now prevails generally in Native States, and is not uncommon in private contracts on British territory, was in force in Āpastamba's times.

[#2]:  See Colebrooke, Digest, Book III, Text lxviii, for this Sūtra and the following two. Another commentator, quoted by Haradatta, connects this Sūtra with the preceding, and refers it to a poor lessee of land, who cannot pay the value of the crop which was lost through his negligence. A third explanation refers the Sūtra to a cultivator who neglects to till his land. Jagannātha's authorities, the Cintāmaṇi and Ratnākara, agree with Haradatta's first explanation.

That may be known by Sūtra II, 6, 14, 11, "They do not declare it to be a theft if the wife spends money for a good reason during the absence of her husband."'--Haradatta.

# Appendix - +Dyugangā dyugaṅgā

## Goals dhyēyāni
Dyugangā is a work group dedicated to the promotion of ever-victorious Hindu ideals and arts. It's current focus is in presenting important texts for easy study. Long term goal (https://rebrand.ly/dg-archive) is to save texts to last for millennia into the coming post-electronic/ industrial age.

The texts may be presented as 

- audio files (eg: [MahAbhArata audio book project](https://sanskrit.github.io/groups/dyuganga/projects/audio/mbh-audio/)[^lnk_2]), 
- as web pages (eg.
